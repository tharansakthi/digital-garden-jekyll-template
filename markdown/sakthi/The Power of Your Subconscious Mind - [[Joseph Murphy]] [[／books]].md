    - Scientific prayer is the harmonious interaction of the conscious and subconscious levels of mind scientifically directed toward a specific purpose. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=269))
    - Contrary to what many people think, it is not the thing that is believed in that brings an answer to a person’s prayer. Prayers are answered when the individual’s subconscious mind responds to the mental picture or thought in his or her mind. This law of belief is the secret operating principle in all the religions of the world. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=294))
    - The law of life is the law of belief. Belief can be summed up briefly as a thought in your mind. As a person thinks, feels, and believes, so is the condition of his or her mind, body, and circumstances. A technique, a methodology based on an understanding of what you are doing and why you are doing it will help you to bring about a subconscious embodiment of all the good things of life. Essentially, answered prayer is the realisation of your heart’s desire. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=300))
    - The law of your mind is the law of belief. This means to believe in the way your mind works, to believe in belief itself. The belief of your mind is the thought of your mind, just that and nothing else. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=376))
    - Your subconscious mind is reactive. It responds to the nature of your thoughts. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=432))
    - **“Never finish a negative statement. Reverse it immediately and wonders will happen in your life.”** ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=457))

    - You think with your conscious mind, and whatever you habitually think sinks down into your subconscious mind, which then creates according to the nature of your thoughts. Your subconscious mind is the seat of your emotions. It is the creative mind. If you think good, good will follow; if you think evil, evil will follow. This is the way your mind works. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=495))
    - Once the subconscious mind accepts an idea, it begins to execute it. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=498))

    - Your subconscious mind is often referred to as your subjective mind. Your subjective mind is aware of its environment, but not by means of the physical senses. Your subjective mind perceives by intuition. It is the seat of your emotions and the storehouse of memory. Your subjective mind performs its highest functions when your objective senses are not functioning. In other words,** it is that intelligence that makes itself known when the objective mind is suspended or in a sleepy, drowsy state.** ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=543))
    - the natural organs of vision. It has the capacity of clairvoyance and clairaudience: It can see and hear events that are taking place elsewhere. Your subjective mind can leave your body, travel to distant lands, and bring back information that is often of the most exact and truthful character. Through your subjective mind you can read the thoughts of others, read the contents of sealed envelopes, ([[remote viewing]]) or intuit the information on a computer disk without using a disk drive. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=547))
    - **your subconscious mind doesn’t understand a joke. It takes you at your word.** ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=593))

    - The suggestions and statements of others have no power to hurt you. The only power is the movement of your own thought. You can choose to reject the thoughts or statements of others and affirm the good. You have the power to choose how you will react.

    - Watch what you say. You have to account for every idle word. Never say, “I will fail; I will lose my job; I can’t pay the rent.” Your subconscious cannot take a joke. It brings all these things to pass. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=732))

    - Begin to think from the standpoint of the eternal truths and principles of life and not from the standpoint of fear, ignorance, and superstition. Do not let others do your thinking for you. Choose your own thoughts and make your own decisions. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=736))

    - My body and all its organs were created by the infinite intelligence in my subconscious mind. It knows how to heal me. Its wisdom fashioned all my organs, tissues, muscles, and bones. This infinite healing presence within me is now transforming every cell of my being, making me whole and perfect. I give thanks for the healing I know is taking place at this time. Wonderful are the works of the creative intelligence within me. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=817))
        - **Note**: Simple prayer for health, self healing
    - **When you feel physically and mentally disturbed, the best thing you can do is to let go, relax, and still the wheels of your thought processes. Speak to your subconscious mind. Tell it to take over in peace, harmony, and divine order. You will find that all the functions of your body will become normal again. Be sure to speak to your subconscious mind with authority and conviction. It will respond by carrying out your command.** ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=840))
    - Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=885))

    - Keep your conscious mind busy with the expectation of the best, and your subconscious will faithfully reproduce your habitual thinking. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=896))
    - Imagine the happy ending or solution to your problem, feel the thrill of accomplishment, and what you imagine and feel will be accepted by your subconscious mind, which will bring it to pass. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=897))
    - What things soever ye desire; when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=923))
    - The power of imagination and blind belief cannot be overstated. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=968))
    - **The organ of healing is the subconscious mind, and the **^^**process of healing is faith.**^^ ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=986))
    - Different schools of medicine, such as osteopathy, chiropractic, chi qong, acupuncture, and naturopathy, all produce remarkable healings. So do the rites and ceremonies of the various religious beliefs throughout the world. It is obvious that all of these healings are brought about through the subconscious mind—the only healer there is. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=996))
    - Your strongest instinct is the most potent of all autosuggestions. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1002))

    - **Whether the object of your faith be real or false, you will nevertheless obtain the same effects.** Thus, if I believed in Saint Peter’s statue as I should have believed in Saint Peter himself, I shall obtain the same effects that I should have obtained from Saint Peter. But that is superstition. Faith, however, produces miracles; and whether it is true or false faith, it will always produce the same wonders.

        - **Note**: Who created this process? The power to faith. Who is governing this? Or is this is just a metaphysics?
    - It is foolish to believe in something that will hurt or harm you. Remember, it is not the thing believed in that hurts or harms you, but the belief or thought in your mind that creates the result. All your experiences, all your actions, and all the events and circumstances of your life are but the reflections and reactions to your own thought. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1105))
    - While you are praying, you refuse to give any power to the negative conditions or to admit for a second that the healing will not come. This attitude of mind brings about the harmonious union of the conscious and subconscious mind, which releases the healing power. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1120))
        - **Note**: Thus the belief in God helps solving all problems
    - For an effective healing of the body to take place, it is, of course, best if both the conscious and subconscious mind are in a state of fully accepting faith. However, it is not always essential. You can enter into a condition of passivity and receptivity by relaxing the mind and the body and getting into a sleepy state. In this **drowsy state your passivity becomes receptive to subjective impression.** ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1150))
    - “Every cell, nerve, tissue, and organ is now being made whole, pure, and perfect. My whole body is being restored to health and harmony.” ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1191))
    - I asked her why she repeated her affirmation prior to sleep. She told me, “Once it is set in motion in a certain direction, the kinetic action of the subconscious mind continues throughout your sleep. That is why it is so critical to give the subconscious mind something beneficial to work on as you drop off into slumber.” ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1194))
    - Apply the power of prayer therapy in your life. Choose a certain plan, idea, or mental picture. **Unite mentally and emotionally with that idea.** (also discussed in [[Think and Grow Rich - [[Napoleon Hill]] [[/books]]]]) As you remain faithful to your mental attitude, your prayer will be answered. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1209))
    - All your experiences and everything that enters into your life depend upon the nature of the mental building blocks that you use in the construction of your mental home. If your blueprint is full of mental patterns of fear, worry, anxiety, or lack, and if you are despondent, doubtful, and cynical, then the quality of the mental materials you are installing in your mind will come forth as more toil, care, tension, anxiety, and limitation of all kinds. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1243))
    - You are building your mental home all the time, and your thoughts and mental imagery represent your blueprint. Hour by hour, moment by moment, you can build radiant health, success, and happiness by the thoughts you think, the ideas you harbour, the beliefs you accept, and the scenes you rehearse in the hidden studio of your mind. This stately mansion, upon the construction of which you are perpetually engaged, is your personality, your identity in this plane, your whole life story on this earth. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1248))
    - Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1258))
    - **The easiest and most obvious way to formulate an idea is to visualise it, to see it in your mind’s eye as vividly as if it were alive.** ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1270))

    - THE AFFIRMATIVE METHOD ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1348))
    - To affirm is to state that it is so. As you maintain this attitude of mind as true, regardless of all evidence to the contrary, you will receive an answer to your prayer. Your thought can only affirm, for even if you deny something, you are actually affirming the presence of what you deny. Repeating an affirmation, knowing what you are saying and why you are saying it, leads the mind to that state of consciousness where it accepts that which you state as true. Keep on affirming the truths of life until you get the subconscious reaction that satisfies. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1371))

    - ^^**You are the sum total of your own thoughts.**^^ You can keep away from entertaining negative thought and imagery. The way to get rid of darkness is with light; the way to overcome cold is with heat; the **way to overcome negative thought is to substitute it with good thought. Affirm the good, and the bad will vanish.** ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1498))
    - ^^**The instinct of self-preservation is the strongest instinct of your nature,**^^
    - whenever your subconscious mind accepts an idea, it immediately begins to execute it. It uses all its mighty resources to that end. It mobilises all the mental and spiritual laws of your deeper mind. This law is true for good ideas, but it holds true for bad ideas as well. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1555))
    - Your failure to get results may also be a consequence of mentally making statements as: Things are getting worse. I will never get an answer. I see no way out. It is hopeless. I don’t know what to do. I’m all mixed up. ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1563))

    - USE IMAGINATION NOT WILLPOWER ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1585))
        - [[+ use imagination (creative faculty), not will power]] [[Limitation of Will Power]]
    - Enlisting the powers of your subconscious mind is not like pushing against an obstacle. Working harder does not lead to better results. Use no willpower. Instead, visualise the end and the state of freedom it produces. You will find your intellect trying to get in the way, trying to find ways to solve the problem and impose those ways on your subconscious. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1586))
    - **The simple way is the best**. ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1590))
        - [[+ start small, do it fast]] [[+ never aim for perfection]] [[+ do less (do only most significant things)]]
    - Successful prayer requires three basic steps: Acknowledge or admit the problem. Turn the problem over to the subconscious mind, which alone knows the most effective solution or way out. Rest with a sense of deep conviction that it is done. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1596))

    - **Wealth is ultimately nothing more than a subconscious conviction** on the part of the individual. You will not become millionaire by saying, “I am a millionaire, I am a millionaire.” You will grow into a wealth consciousness by building into your mentality the idea of wealth and abundance.

    - One man told me, “I have affirmed that I am prosperous, until I am tired. Things are now worse. I knew when I made the statement that it was obviously not true.” His statements were rejected by the conscious mind, and the opposite of what he outwardly affirmed and claimed was made manifest. Your affirmation succeeds best when it is specific and when it does not produce a mental conflict or argument.

    - The following is the ideal way to overcome this conflict for those who have this difficulty. Make this practical statement frequently, particularly prior to sleep: “By day and by night I am being prospered in all of my interests.” This affirmation will not arouse any argument because it does not contradict your subconscious mind’s impression of financial lack. I suggested to one businessman whose sales and finances were extremely low and who was greatly worried that he sit down in his office, become quiet, and repeat this statement over and over: “My sales are improving every day.” This statement engaged the cooperation of the conscious and subconscious mind, and results followed.

    - Your wealth is never truly dependent on bonds, stocks, or money in the bank; these are only symbols—necessary and useful, of course, but only symbols.

    - If you set your heart on money exclusively and say, “Money is all I want; I am going to give all my attention to amassing money; nothing else matters,” you can get money and gain a fortune, but at what cost! You have forgotten that you are here to lead a balanced life. You must also satisfy the hunger for peace of mind, harmony, love, joy, and perfect health. ([Location 1793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1793))
    - By making money your sole aim, you made a wrong choice. You thought that was all you wanted, but you found after all your efforts that it was not only the money you needed.

    - I like money. I love it. I use it wisely, constructively, and judiciously. Money is constantly circulating in my life. I release it with joy, and it returns to me multiplied in a wonderful way. It is good and very good. Money flows to me in avalanches of abundance. I use it for good only, and I am grateful for my good and for the riches of my mind. ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=1810))
        - **Note**: I Differ:
You never know the cost of it. And wealth is important, Not the money or to show off.
Let the universe give you what you want when you need it. Is the right prayer. 

When you can get everything through your sub conscious there is no need to pray separate for money. For eg if I want peace. Then only if I don’t have problem with money shortages I can be in peace

    - The first step in conveying your clarified desire, idea, or image to the deeper mind is to relax, immobilise the attention, get still, and be quiet. This quiet, relaxed, and peaceful attitude of mind prevents extraneous matter and false ideas from interfering with your mental absorption of your ideal. Furthermore, in the quiet, passive, and receptive attitude of mind, effort is reduced to a minimum. ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=2007))

    - **When you have to make what you think will be a difficult decision, or when you fail to see the solution to your problem, begin at once to think constructively about it. If you are fearful and worried, you are not really thinking. True thinking is free from fear.** [[Thinking]] [[Flow State of Mind]]([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H38S9NQ&location=2159))
    - **Quiet the mind and still the body. Tell the body to relax; it has to obey you. It has no volition, initiative, or self-conscious intelligence. Your body is an emotional disk that records your beliefs and impressions. Mobilise your attention; focus your thought on the solution to your problem. Try to solve it with your conscious mind. Think how happy you would be about the perfect solution. Sense the feeling you would have if the perfect answer were yours now. Let your mind play with this mood of happiness and contentment in a relaxed way; then drop off to sleep. When you awaken, if you do not have the answer, get busy with something else. While you are preoccupied with something else, it is possible that the answer will pop into your mind. **
    - The secret of guidance or right action is to mentally devote yourself to the right answer until you find its response in you. The response is a feeling, an inner awareness, an overpowering hunch whereby you know that you know. You have used the power to the point where it begins to use you. You cannot possibly fail or make one false step while operating under the subjective wisdom within you. You will find that all your ways are pleasantness and all your paths are peace.

    - If you get angry, you have to go through four stages in your mind. You begin to think about what was said. You decide to get angry and generate an emotion of rage. Then you decide to act. Perhaps you talk back and react in kind. As you see, the thought, emotion, reaction, and action all take place in your own mind.

    - The hateful, frustrated, distorted, and twisted personality is out of tune with the infinite. The person resents those who are peaceful, happy, and joyous. Usually he criticises, condemns, and vilifies those who have been very good and kind to him. His attitude is this: Why should they be so happy when I am so miserable? He wants to drag them down to his own level. The old saying is still true, that “misery loves company.” Once you understand this, you remain unmoved, calm, and dispassionate.

Remain true to your ideal. Know definitely and absolutely that whatever contributes to your peace, happiness, and fulfillment must of necessity bless all people who walk the earth. The harmony of the part is the harmony of the whole; for the whole is in the part, and the part is in the whole.

    - Habit is a function of our subconscious minds. We learned to swim, ride a bicycle, dance, and drive a car by consciously doing these things over and over again until they established tracks in our subconscious minds. Then, the automatic habit action of the subconscious mind took over. This is sometimes referred to as “second nature,” that is, the reaction of the subconscious mind to the thinking and acting that makes up our “first” nature.
