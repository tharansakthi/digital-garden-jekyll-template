- Superior Virtue is one who stops seeking, stops learning new, examining principles, and stops practising to be a virtuous man and gets in the [[Flow in Life]] i.e. [[Wu Wei]]. Basically having [[No Virtue]] is Superior Virtue.
    - Where you reached the natural flow, the course is set right, you don't have to do anything more.
        - "Superior virtue has no doing (or Wu Wei)," and you enter the practice of Xing (Nature): is there any need of repairing or harmonizing what is damaged or full? - Chinese Poem
        - Superior virtue is not for or against any principles or expecting a particular result of being. When you are in flow, your natural order, you are at it, you don't need anything else to be better or to achieve. So as there is nothing you need to change or reach, you don't have to examine your methods or path and you don't seek a better path. Everything ends here. 
- [[Inferior Virtue]] is one who does things for virtue, and trying to be virtuous or better against their natural flow.
- Superior Virtue vs Inferior Virtue
    - "Superior virtue has no doing":
it does not use examining and seeking.
"Inferior virtue does":
its operation does not rest. - [[Cantong Qi]] #/quotes
    - Superior virtue performs the way of non-doing and thus fulfils Nature. Inferior virtue performs the way of doing and thus fulfils Life. - [[Liu Yiming]]
    - Superior virtue has no intention to be virtuous And thus is virtue. Inferior virtue cannot let go of virtuosity and thus is not virtue. - [[Tao Te Ching]]
        - Basically not holding any virtue and flowing with [[Flow in Life]] [[Flow State of Mind]] with the conscious of duty but not the result is the greatest virtue of all.
- Once you can attain the [[oneness]] with [[Tao]], you are virtuous without being virtuous.  There is no intention, there is no desire.  Everything comes along naturally with spontaneity [[Flow in Life]].  This is something you cannot achieve simply by following any form of codes of conduct. [[No Virtue]] [[No Technique]]
