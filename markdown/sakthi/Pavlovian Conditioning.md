- Also known as Classical Conditioning
- Experiment: Changing Dog reflex [[Dog Psychology]] [[Dog Training]]
    -  [[Dog]] conditioned to drool on whistle sound instead of seeing food
        - potent stimulus - food
        - neutral stimulus - bell (which is not associated to any stimuli & response pair)
        - previous stiumuli - response pair
            - food - salivation
        - after conditioning 
            - bell -  salivation
- ### Operant Conditioning or Instrumental Conditioning
