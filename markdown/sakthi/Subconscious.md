    - [[Unconscious]] is close to subconscious butit can't be seen with mere awareness, but only with [[Meditation]].  
- Subconscious is a bigger portion which can be explored by shifting our awareness more inside and exploring thoughts
    - [[Unconscious]] is explored by keenly evaluating our cause of thoughts and tracing back its origin. Also kind of [[Shadow Work]] and [[Meditation]]
