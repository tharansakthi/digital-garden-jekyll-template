**Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.**
**The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.**
Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.
When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.

Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.
It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.^^ - [[Marcus Aurelius]] [[Power of thoughts]] [[The Constant Change]]
