- [[Tao]] 
    - It encompasses everything that we can't perceive. 
        - It is beyond human understanding (basically it is not possible to sense Tao with 5 senses human have)
        - words, colour, language limits our ability to feel or explain the Tao
        - He who stands on tiptoe, doesn't stand firm.
He who rushes ahead, doesn't go far.
He who tries to shine, dims his own light.
He who defines himself, can't know who he really is.
He who has power over others, can't empower himself.
He who clings to his work, will create nothing that endures.
**If you want to accord with the Tao, just do your job, then let go**. 
- [[Lao Tzu]]
