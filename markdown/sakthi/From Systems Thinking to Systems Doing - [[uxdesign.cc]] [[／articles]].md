        - ^^**A system is never the sum of its parts; it’s the product of their interaction**^^
        - The performance of a system depends on ^^how the parts fit, not how they act taken separately^^ 
            - **the process matters more than the product**
                - [[+ you become what you do repeatedly (pattern)]]
        - ^^**A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked**^^
        - ^^**The system always kicks back**^^
Complex systems exhibit unexpected behavior. It is almost as they would have their own will, and that will is not friendly with changes.
            - **Note**: Also correct for organisation management [[team management]] [[Organisational Information Management]]
        - ^^When a system is set up to accomplish a goal, a new entity has come into being — the system itself^^

Systems designers break down problems to identify how to render them obsolete, instead of adding more functionality that will create more problems in the future. 
            - Simplify instead of complicating to solve a problem. Prefer to remove a module instead of adding.
