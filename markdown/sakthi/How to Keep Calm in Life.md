- Author:: [[Epicurus]] 
    - [[ataraxia]] translated as [[Equanimity]] or [[tranquility]]
    - ^^Right amount of Pleasure with [[Wisdom]] and [[Moderation]] = Key to Happy Life (Calm Life)^^ 
        - According to Author (In this context) - ^^[[Pleasure]] = Absence of Pain^^
    - # How to Achieve Peaceful & Calm Existence (2 things Needed)
        1. ## [[Moderation]] of Pleasure (to eliminate the anxiety of not fulfilling one's desire)
            - ## 2 types of [[Pleasure]]
                1. ### Moving Pleasure
                    - Momentary pleasures that involve an active stimulation of the senses
                        - eg. eating a chocolate = gives pleasure only until you have taste in your mouth
                2. ### Static Pleasure (Best form of Pleasure)
                    - Feeling of contentment (once it is fulfilled or satisfied)
                        - eg. your hunger is satisfied, or when you feel no longer painful
                    - ## 2 Type of Desires
                        1. [[natural desires]]
                            - ^^we can reach this pleasure by fulfilling our [[natural desires]] of the things that are **necessary for survival**.^^
                            - 2 types of [[natural desires]]
                                1. ### ^^[[Necessary Natural Desires]]^^
                                    - Food, shelter, and rest are necessary and [[natural desires]]
                                    - __note: contd. after the end of this classification__
                                2. ### [[Unnecessary Natural Desires]]
                                    - expensive wine served on a silver platter fulfils our natural desire for food, but it is unnecessary to eat so luxuriously
                                        - Luxury is **hardest to obtain and maintain**
                                            - Note: Not because you can't earn it, it's because you have to work for luxury, instead of luxury works for you. 
                                            - you pursue this way of maintaining luxury, forgetting the [[Flow in Life]]
                        2. [[vain desires]]
                            - Money, Fame, Power, Immortality
                                - Based on certain Man-made ideas- Humans have these unwanted intellectual goals in reacting to the situation
                            - **These are insatiable, because it has no natural limit. Pursuing these pleasures leads to more cravings, and because of this, we always feel restless and never content**
                                - also - Luxury is **hardest to obtain and maintain**
            - ^^In order to reach [[inner peace]], we must aim for the fulfilment of necessary natural desires, because they are abundant and have a natural limit^^
                - ^^The absence of the anxiety of not fulfilling one's desires in the future leads to [[Equanimity]].^^
                    - [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] [[Maslow's Motivation Model]]
            - ^^You have to [moderate]([[Moderation]]) everything you do^^.  even if it is [[Necessary Natural Desires]]. Choosing [[* Middle Way]]
                - like overeating, drinking too much
        2. ## Let go ([[Wu Wei]]) of groundless fear 
            - (fear that withholds us from achieving [[peace of mind]]) 
            - ### Two [[Collective Unconscious]] fears of human
                1. Fear of God (Wrong doings) - பாவம் 
                    - The prospectus of getting punished leads to unnecessary fear.
                        - Note: So **necessary fear is good?**
                            - The fear system keeps in line, but also causes unnecessary suffering
                    - **Do good all time. so that you don't have to fear.**
                        - According to Epicurus, the Gods are perfect beings, and their involvement with us, inferior humans, would go against their perfect nature. Thus, divine intervention is out of the question. 
                            - [[Law of Attraction]] - & ^^**Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.**^^ - [[Carl Jung]] #/quotes [[Law of Attraction]]
                2. Fear of Death (Going to Hell) - தண்டனை 
                    - "Death is nothing to us.
For what has been dissolved has [[no sense-experience]], and what has no sense-experience is nothing to us." #/quotes
                        - you don't have to worry or fear for what you don't have to sense it.
                        - [[no sense-experience]] is [[Spirituality]], so you don't have to fear within [[Intellectual]] experience
