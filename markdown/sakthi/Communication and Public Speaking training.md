- # Stage Fear Avoidance Practices [[stage fear]]
    - ## Slow / Soft approach
        1. Close your eyes and speak on the stage 
            - Before that you have to imagine that you're speaking good and audience is listening good [[+ use imagination (creative faculty), not will power]]
            - face your friend and avoid seeing others
    - ## Crash / Fast approach
        1. Focus the one person and talk - face the fear
            - Stand on the stage and shout your name. Spell your name. Shift your focus on what you're doing not on the audience. 
            - Face the person you are afraid to face from stage, later slowly see more people
            - Ralph Waldo Emerson, the great nineteenth-century philosopher and poet, said, “**Do the thing you are afraid to do, and the death of fear is certain**.” #/quotes [[overcome fear]] [[fear of death]]
