        - They use lie, violence, twist fact, threat and other vile acts
            - Opinion : remember bad people may lose or die at end, but good too and the bad (effects) stay here in the world. and it techs the future that bad is a easy way. Can't blame the ignorant people who believed the 'bad people' and supported them against good. They are also victim.
