    - Sit, kill the urge to procrastinate
    - Review and renew your literature survey
    - Make a complete first draft
        - Editing as you go will not let you complete your work
            - Do not try to perfect the work when you start. The sentence you may correct now might become irrelevant after sometime. So perfecting will waste the time
            - Perfect is the enemy of good
    - Write for the Journal intended and the reviewers. Reviewers are the Gate keepers. So consider them as your primary audience
