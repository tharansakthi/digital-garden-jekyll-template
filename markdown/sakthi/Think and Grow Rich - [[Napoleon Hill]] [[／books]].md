    - Riches begin with state of mind. 
    - Action starts from **desire**. Know what you want, (**definiteness of purpose**) then act upon it with **strong faith** (emotion). 
    - Thoughts (determination) + emotions (feeds energy to thought) = physical equivalent 
        - Thoughts (your determination) should be persistent [[Auto Suggestion]]
            - even temporary defeats will be the opportunity in disguise as [[Infinite Intelligence]] always do good for you [[Nova Effect]]
            - every adversity brings with it the seed of an equivalent advantage, ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=640))

            - The Seven Major Positive Emotions   
            - The Seven Major Negative Emotions (To be avoided)   
        - **strong desire and feelings are from conscious mind -> easily picked up by subconscious mind -> to infinite intelligence -> Reality**
    - Two forms of imagination mind or faculty of the mind. Both are important for success. Not 1 acts without another. [[Human Insanity]] + [[Infinite Intelligence]] [*](((Fz1lmitjA)))
        - **Synthetic Imagination **(from logical reasoning [[First Principles Thinking]]) [[Intelligence]]
        - **Creative Imagination** (from [[Infinite Intelligence]]) - [[Creative Imagination]]
    - Action and Prompt Decision
        - [[+ think quick, plan flexible, decide promptly, do it fast, but don't rush]]
        - **most ideas are still-born, and need the breath of life injected into them through definite plans of immediate action.** 
        - decisiveness is the primary character of a leader and successful person
            - Put your desire before others and other's opinions  & then decide
                - I**If the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it! Put your dream across, and never mind what “they” say if you meet with temporary defeat, for “they,” perhaps, do not know that every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent success.** ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=526)) [[FOPO]] [[FOMO]]
            - speak less, listen more
        - Indecision crystalizes into doubt, the two blend and become fear! [[decision-making]]
    - SEX [[libido]] improves [[personal magnetism]] - Greater successful men are highly sexed men (but not womanisers ) - SEX [[Love/Eros]] (with LOVE, & ROMANCE)
        -  [[Sexual Transmutation]]
            - SEX energy is creative energy
            - ^^**When the emotion of love begins to mix itself with the emotion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy of judgment, and balance.**^^
                - love is spiritual, sex is biological. So romance is between two?
        - women (wife, secretary, anyone with you) should be in harmony and they can influence and inspire your creativity
            - [[Briffault's Law]] Beware in selecting women, **you need right woman**

    - # Chapter 1 — Introduction
        - That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=185))
        - He had nothing to start with, except the capacity to know what he wanted, and the determination to stand by that desire until he realized it. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=198))
        - One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=205))
        - When you begin to think and grow rich, you will observe that **riches begin with a state of mind**, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no hard work. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=297))
        - **Success comes to those who become success conscious.** Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become failure conscious. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=311))
        - **“Go right ahead,” said Ford, “I want it, and I’ll have it.”** They went ahead, and then, as if by a stroke of magic, the secret was discovered. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=336))
        - The Ford determination had won once more! ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=337))
        - we are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls, because we have the power to control our thoughts. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=347))
        - He should have told us that the ether in which this little earth floats, in which we move and have our being, is a form of energy moving at an inconceivably high rate of vibration, and that the ether is filled with a form of universal power which adapts itself to the nature of the thoughts we hold in our minds; and influences us, in natural ways, to transmute our thoughts into their physical equivalent. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=348))
        - Captains of our Souls. He should have told us, with great emphasis, that this power makes no attempt to discriminate between destructive thoughts and constructive thoughts, that it will urge us to translate into physical reality thoughts of poverty, just as quickly as it will influence us to act upon thoughts of riches. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=353))
            - **Note**: The concept spoken in The power of Subconscious Mind
        - our brains become magnetized with the dominating thoughts which we hold in our minds, and, by means with which no man is familiar, these “magnets” attract to us the forces, the people, the circumstances of life which harmonize with the nature of our dominating thoughts.

    - # Chapter 2 — Desire: The Starting Point of All Achievement
        - Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to **burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win, essential to success.** ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=448))
        - First. Be definite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter). Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as something for nothing.) Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire. Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action. Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it. Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. As you read-see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=466))

        - “The greatest achievement was, at first, and for a time, but a dream.” “The oak sleeps in the acorn. The bird waits in the egg, and in the highest vision of the soul, a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of reality.” ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=545))

        - There is a difference between wishing for a thing and being ready to receive it. **No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it.** The state of mind must be belief, not mere hope or wish. **Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief.** ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=587))

    - # Chapter 3 — Faith Visualization of, and Belief in Attainment of Desire
        - Faith is the head chemist of the mind. **When faith is blended with the vibration of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration, translates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Infinite Intelligence, as in the case of prayer.** ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=777))
            - **Tags**: #[[blue]]
        - The emotions of faith, love, and sex are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions. When the three are blended, they have the effect of “coloring” the vibration of thought in such a way that it instantly reaches the subconscious mind, where it is changed into its spiritual equivalent, the only form that induces a response from Infinite Intelligence. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=780))
            - **Tags**: #[[blue]]
        - Love and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is purely biological, and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication between the finite, thinking mind of man, and Infinite Intelligence. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=783))
            - **Tags**: #[[blue]]
        - The method by which one develops faith, where it does not already exist, is extremely difficult to describe, almost as difficult, in fact, as it would be to describe the color of red to a blind man who has never seen color, and has nothing with which to compare what you describe to him. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=796))
        - “When men first come into contact with crime, they abhor it. If they remain in contact with crime for a time, they become accustomed to it, and endure it. If they remain in contact with it long enough, they finally embrace it, and become influenced by it.” ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=802))
        - all thoughts which have been emotionalized, (given feeling) and mixed with faith, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counterpart. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=807))
            - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
        - The emotions, or the “feeling” portion of thoughts, are the factors which give thoughts vitality, life, and action. The emotions of Faith, Love, and Sex, when mixed with any thought impulse, give it greater action than any of these emotions can do singly. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=809))
            - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
        - If it be true that one may become a criminal by association with crime, (and this is a known fact), it is equally true that one may develop faith by voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. The mind comes, finally, to take on the nature of the influences which dominate it. Understand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to encourage the positive emotions as dominating forces of your mind, and discourage and eliminate negative emotions. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=832))
            - **Note**: Meditation is a process of eliminating negativity

        - Thoughts which are mixed with any of the feelings of emotions, constitute a “magnetic” force which attracts, from the vibrations of the ether, other similar, or related thoughts. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=865))

        - A thought thus “magnetized” with emotion may be compared to a seed which, when planted in fertile soil, germinates, grows, and multiplies itself over and over again, until that which was originally one small seed, becomes countless millions of seeds of the same brand! ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=867))
        - you will discover that your greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence. This handicap can be surmounted, and timidity translated into courage, through the aid of the principle of autosuggestion. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=884))
        - all impulses of thought have a tendency to clothe themselves in their physical equivalent. ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=913))
        - “[[suggestive suicide]].” A man may commit suicide through negative suggestion, ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=919))
        - Like the wind which carries one ship East, and another West, the law of auto-suggestion will lift you up or pull you down, according to the way you set your sails of thought. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=931))

        - “If I should really want to answer the foolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been asking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric push-buttons on my desk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can answer any question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am devoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, why I should clutter up my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer questions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I require?” ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1310))

    - # Chapter 6 — Imagination: The Workshop of the Mind
        - ## Two Forms of Imagination
            - The imaginative faculty functions in two forms. One is known as “synthetic imagination,” and the other as “creative imagination.” ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1573))
            - **Synthetic imagination**: Through this faculty, one may arrange old concepts, ideas, or plans into new combinations. This faculty creates nothing. It merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with which it is fed. ...** Creative imagination**: Through the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. ... This faculty functions only when the conscious mind is vibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example, when the conscious mind is stimulated through the emotion of a strong desire. The creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from the sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through use. ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1575))
                - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
                - **Note**:
            - conscious mind is stimulated through the emotion of a strong desire. ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1584))
            - Both the synthetic and creative faculties of imagination become more alert with use, just as any muscle or organ of the body develops through use. Desire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart. While the synthetic imagination is the one which will be used most frequently, in the process of transforming the impulse of desire into money, ... you may face circumstances and situations which demand use of the creative imagination as well. ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1592))
        - ## How to Make Practical Use of Imagination
            - ^^Generally speaking, an idea is an impulse of thought that impels action, by an appeal to the imagination. All master salesmen know that ideas can be sold where merchandise cannot. Ordinary salesmen do not know this-that is why they are “ordinary”. A publisher of books, which sell for a nickel, made a discovery that should be worth much to publishers generally. He learned that many people buy titles, and not contents of books. By merely changing the name of one book that was not moving, his sales on that book jumped upward more than a million copies. The inside of the book was not changed in any way. He merely ripped off the cover bearing the title that did not sell, and put on a new cover with a title that had “box-office” value. That, as simple as it may seem, was an idea! It was imagination. There is no standard price on ideas. The creator of ideas makes his own price, and, if he is smart, gets it. The moving picture industry created a whole flock of millionaires. Most of them were men who couldn’t create ideas-BUT-they had the imagination to recognize ideas when they saw them.^^ ([Location 1751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1751))
    - # Chapter 7 — Organized Planning: The Crystallization of Desire into Action
        - there are two types of people in the world. One type is known as leaders, and the other as followers. ... It is no disgrace to be a follower. On the other hand, it is no credit to remain a follower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They became great leaders because they were intelligent followers. ... The man who can follow a leader most efficiently, is usually the man who develops into leadership most rapidly. An intelligent follower has many advantages, among them the opportunity to acquire knowledge from his leader. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1887))
        - ### The 10 Major Causes of Failure in [[Leadership]]
            - **Chapter Note:**
            - 1. Inability to organize details. ... The successful leader must be the master of all details connected with his position. ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1944))
            - 2. Unwillingness to render humble service. Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. “The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all” ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1948))
            - 3. Expectation of pay for what they “know” instead of what they do with that which they know. The world does not pay men for that which they “know.” It pays them for what they do, or induce others to do. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1951))
            - 4. Fear of competition from followers. The leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men receive more pay for their ability to get others to perform, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An efficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of others, and induce them to render more service and better service than they could render without his aid. ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1953))
            - 5. Lack of imagination. Without imagination, the leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans by which to guide his followers efficiently. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1959))
            - 6. Selfishness. The leader who claims all the honor for the work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. ... he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone. ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1961))
            - 7. Intemperance. Followers do not respect an intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in it. ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1964))
            - 8. Disloyalty. ... The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his associates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long maintain his leadership. ([Location 1966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1966))
            - 9. Emphasis of the “authority” of leadership. The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instill fear in the hearts of his followers. ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1970))
            - 10. Emphasis of title. The competent leader requires no “title” to give him the respect of his followers. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=1974))
            - ### Major Causes of [[failure]]

                - **Lack of controlled sexual urge**. Sex energy is the most powerful of all the stimuli which move people into action. Because it is the most powerful of the emotions, it must be controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other channels. ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2269))
                - Uncontrolled desire for “something for nothing.” ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2271))
                - Over-caution. ([Location 2282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2282))

                - The habit of indiscriminate spending. The spend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in fear of poverty. Form the habit of systematic saving by putting aside a definite percentage of your income. ([Location 2294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2294))
                - Intolerance. The person with a “closed” mind on any subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has stopped acquiring knowledge. ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2299))
                - Intemperance. The most damaging forms of intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success. ([Location 2302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2302))
                - Possession of power that was not acquired through self-effort. (Sons and daughters of wealthy men, and others who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in the hands of one who did not acquire it gradually, is often fatal to success. Quick riches are more dangerous than poverty. [[Nepotism]]
                - Egotism and vanity. ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2312))
                - Money, without brains, always is dangerous. ([Location 2470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2470))
    - # Chapter 8 — Decision: The Mastery of Procrastination
        - One of Henry Ford’s most outstanding qualities is his habit of reaching decisions quickly and definitely, and changing them slowly. ([Location 2626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2626))
        - **The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their needs, are, generally, easily influenced by the “opinions” of others.** [[FOPO]] They permit the newspapers and the “gossiping” neighbors to do their “thinking” for them. “Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by “opinions” when you reach decisions, you will not succeed in any undertaking, much less in that of transmuting your own desire into money. ([Location 2632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2632))
            - **Note**: except the members of your “Master Mind” group, and be very sure in your selection of this group, that you choose only those who will be in complete sympathy and harmony with your purpose.

        - Poverty is attracted to the one whose mind is favorable to it, as money is attracted to him whose mind has been deliberately prepared to attract it, and through the same laws. ([Location 2872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=2872))

            - **Note**: The third mind is God or [[Infinite Intelligence]]
    - # Chapter 11 — The Mystery of Sex: Transmutation
        - Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching of the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some other nature. ([Location 3299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3299))
            - **Note**: [[Sexual Transmutation]]
        - it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, mind, and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets through purely physical channels. ([Location 3307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3307))
        - When lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind stimulation, an individual occupies, relatively, the same position as one who has ascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see over and beyond the horizon line which limits his vision, while on the ground. ([Location 3374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3374))
        - The reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one’s accumulated experience. Not all knowledge, which one accumulates through “experience,” is accurate.^^** Ideas received through the creative faculty are much more reliable, for the reason that they come from sources more reliable than any which are available to the reasoning faculty of the mind.**^^
            - [[Infinite Intelligence]] [[Creativity]] [[decision-making]]
        - ^^**The human mind responds to stimulation! Among the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of sex. ... Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii.**^^** ... The mere possession of this energy is not sufficient to produce a genius. The energy must be transmuted from desire for physical contact, into some other form of desire and action, before it will lift one to the status of a genius.** ([Location 3441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3441))
        - ### Why Men Seldom Succeed Before Forty
            - People are influenced in their actions, not by reason so much as by “feelings.” The creative faculty of the mind is set into action entirely by emotions, and not by cold reason. ([Location 3501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3501))
                - **Note**: 
            - the factor of personality known as “[[personal magnetism]]” is nothing more nor less than sex energy. Highly sexed people always have a plentiful supply of magnetism. ([Location 3509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3509))
                - **Note**: **women, girls are good stimulation for creativity if they are not seen as sexual object but as sexual feeling stimulus. If this turns to physical, then this sex urge being released will waste. This urge should be transmuted. **
#[[?questions]] may be this is why women couldn’t get the magnetism after some age, or they might be sexual if they are with magnetism. [[libido]]
Basically people lack sex energy can’t influence others. [[female sexuality]]
            - ^^**When the emotion of love begins to mix itself with the emotion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy of judgment, and balance.**^^
                - **Note**: driven by his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may steal, cheat, and even commit murder.
Sex with other emotions like jealousy are deadly poison 
Romance is between love and sex.
            - Reformation means, “a change of heart.” It does not mean a “change of head.” ([Location 3586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3586))
                - **Note**: Heart is love, while head is lust and sex
            - The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, love, and romance. ([Location 3600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3600))
            - **The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of will-power**, ([Location 3602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3602))
            - **Even the memories of love are sufficient to lift one to a higher plane of creative effort**. The major force of love may spend itself and pass away, like a fire which has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible marks as evidence that it passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater love. ([Location 3621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3621))
            - ^^**If you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have “loved and lost,” perish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes when it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it remains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring it back.**^^ ([Location 3627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3627))
            - ^^**love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No experience, which touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful, except through ignorance, or jealousy.**^^ ([Location 3635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3635))
            - Love, alone, will not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind, closest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane. When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the obstructions between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence are removed. ... Where love, romance and the proper understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is no disharmony between married people. ([Location 3645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3645))
            - **Man has the same desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of civilization. The only thing that has changed, is his method of pleasing.** Men who accumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights of power and fame, do so, mainly, to satisfy their desire to please women. ([Location 3667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3667))
            - **Most men will not admit that they are easily influenced by the women they prefer, because it is in the nature of the male to want to be recognized as the stronger of the species. Moreover, the intelligent woman recognizes this “manly trait” and very wisely makes no issue of it. Some men know that they are being influenced by the women of their choice-their wives, sweethearts, mothers or sisters-but they tactfully refrain from rebelling against the influence because they are intelligent enough to know that no man is happy or complete without the modifying influence of the right woman. **([Location 3673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08776ZZY4&location=3673))

    - Inability to organize details.
        - **Tags**: #[[c1]]
    - Unwillingness to render humble service. Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. “The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all”
    - Expectation of pay for what they “know” instead of what they do with that which they know. The world does not pay men for that which they “know.” It pays them for what they do, or induce others to do.
    - Fear of competition from followers. The leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men receive more pay for their ability to get others to perform, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An efficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of others, and induce them to render more service and better service than they could render without his aid.
    - Lack of imagination. Without imagination, the leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans by which to guide his followers efficiently.
    - Selfishness. The leader who claims all the honor for the work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment.
        - **Tags**: #[[c1]]
    - Intemperance. Followers do not respect an intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in it.
    - Disloyalty.
        - **Tags**: #[[c1]]
    - Emphasis of the “authority” of leadership. The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instill fear in the hearts of his followers.
    - Emphasis of title. The competent leader requires no “title” to give him the respect of his followers.
