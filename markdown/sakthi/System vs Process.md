- As a general rule, processes address __effectiveness__, whereas systems address __efficiency__.” If you’re doing the right slower than they could otherwise be done, work on your systems. If you’re working fast but not really getting anywhere, work on your processes. Default to processes if you’re not sure either way.
- **systems support processes**
    - The Dropbox __system__makes the __process__ of sharing and collaborating on files easier

    - **Process**
        - **Systems**
    - When we look at something and see the buildings, the people, the relationships, the activities and the **interactions** we are observing a system.
        - When we look at something and see a **sequence of activities/ steps** producing outputs we are observing a process.
    - A process produces results through **work being done** in the process.
        - A system produces results through the **interaction of elements**
    - Processes produce outputs
        - Systems create outcomes
    - Process owners manage process outputs (Individual)
        - System managers manage outcomes (Leaders)
