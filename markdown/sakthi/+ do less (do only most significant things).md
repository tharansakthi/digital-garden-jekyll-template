    - [[The 5 AM Club - [[Robin Sharma]] [[/books]]]] talks about For the next ninety days, schedule yourself to invest the first ninety minutes of your workday on the one activity that, when completed at world-class, will cause you to own your field. This ninety-minute period must be completely free of any noise and interruptions. Place your devices in a bag marked, “for my 90/90/1 period.” And then leave that bag in another room. Installing clear boundary fences that block access to temptations is a potent tactic to decrease them. ([Location 3630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L872Z1B&location=3630))
