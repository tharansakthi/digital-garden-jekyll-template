    - Mindful leaders don’t need to motivate through fear or manipulation because their people are self-motivated. 
    - By cultivating self mastery, mindful leaders are able to **navigate stressful situations with calm and clarity.** [[+ when you can't think clearly, you follow your past pattern]] [[+ when you're in fear, you're not thinking]]
