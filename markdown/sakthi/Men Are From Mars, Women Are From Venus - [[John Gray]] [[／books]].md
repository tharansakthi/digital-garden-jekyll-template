    - ^^She has right to upset. Don’t expect her to be okay all time despite doing everything for her. When she blames, she doesn’t hold to it, so don’t take it personally but listen empathetically. ^^

    - fair-weather friend.
        - **Note**: A friend who is there with you when everything is fine and as long as you are able to give. When you can’t, when the whether is hard they distance themselves. [[Interpersonal Psychology]] [[fair-weather friend]]
    - Problems are inevitable. But these problems either can be sources of resentment and rejection or can be opportunities for deepening intimacy and increasing love, caring, and trust.
    - ### REMEMBERING OUR DIFFERENCES
        - We mistakenly assume that if our partners love us they will react and behave in certain ways—the ways we react and behave when we love someone. ... Men mistakenly expect women to think, communicate, and react the way men do; women mistakenly expect men to feel, communicate, and respond the way women do. We have forgotten that men and women are supposed to be different.
        - ### GOOD INTENTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH
            - By validating and accepting our differences, creative solutions can be discovered whereby we can succeed in getting what we want. And, more important, we can learn how to best love and support the people we care about. Love is magical, and it can last, if we remember our differences.
            - ### LIFE ON MARS
                - Martians value power, competency, efficiency, and achievement. They are always doing things to prove themselves and develop their power and skills. Their sense of self is defined through their ability to achieve results. They experience fulfillment primarily through success and accomplishment.
                - They are more interested in “objects” and “things” rather than people and feelings. ... Men are preoccupied with the “things” that can help them express power by creating results and achieving their goals.
- ### New #[[/highlights]] added [[April 11th, 2021]] at 12:14 AM
    - Martians pride themselves in doing things all by themselves. Autonomy is a symbol of efficiency, power, and competence.
    - To offer a man unsolicited advice is to presume that he doesn’t know what to do or that he can’t do it on his own.
    - He keeps his problems to himself unless he requires help from another to find a solution. Asking for help when you can do it yourself is perceived as a sign of weakness. However, if he truly does need help, then it is a sign of wisdom to get it. In this case, he will find someone he respects and then talk about his problem. Talking about a problem on Mars is an invitation for advice. Another Martian feels honored by the opportunity.
    - ### LIFE ON VENUS
        - They value love, communication, beauty, and relationships. They spend a lot of time supporting, helping, and nurturing one another. Their sense of self is defined through their feelings and the quality of their relationships. They experience fulfillment through sharing and relating.
        - A woman’s sense of self is defined through her feelings and the quality of her relationships.
        - To share their personal feelings is much more important than achieving goals and success. Talking and relating to one another is a source of tremendous fulfillment.
        - A sign of great love is to offer help and assistance to another Venusian without being asked.
        - offering help is not offensive, and needing help is not a sign of weakness.
        - On Venus it is a sign of caring to give advice and suggestions. Venusians firmly believe that when something is working it can always work better. Their nature is to want to improve things.
        - Martians are more solution oriented. If something is working, their motto is don’t change it. Their instinct is to leave it alone if it is working. “Don’t fix it unless it is broken” is a common expression.
        - GIVE UP GIVING ADVICE
        - when a woman offers unsolicited advice or tries to “help” a man, she has no idea of how critical and unloving she may sound to him.
            - **Note**: #-useforsummary
        - LEARNING TO LISTEN
        - women talk about problems to get close and not necessarily to get solutions.
        - A way of honoring another Venusian is to listen patiently with empathy, seeking truly to understand the other’s feelings.
        - To summarize the two most common mistakes we make in relationships: 1. A man tries to change a woman’s feelings when she is upset by becoming Mr. Fix-It and offering solutions to her problems that invalidate her feelings. 2. A woman tries to change a man’s behavior when he makes mistakes by becoming the home-improvement committee and offering unsolicited advice or criticism.
        - A woman greatly appreciates Mr. Fix-It, as long as he doesn’t come out when she is upset. Men need to remember that when women seem upset and talk about problems is not the time to offer solutions; instead she needs to be heard, and gradually she will feel better on her own. She does not need to be fixed.
        - A man greatly appreciates the home-improvement committee, as long as it is requested. Women need to remember that unsolicited advice or criticism—especially if he has made a mistake—makes him feel unloved and controlled. He needs her acceptance more than her advice, in order to learn from his mistakes. When a man feels that a woman is not trying to improve him, he is much more likely to ask for her feedback and advice.
        - When our partner resists us it is probably because we have made a mistake in our timing or approach.
        - When a woman resists a man’s solutions he feels his competence is being questioned. As a result he feels mistrusted, unappreciated, and stops caring. His willingness to listen understandably lessens.
        - When a man resists a woman’s suggestions she feels as though he doesn’t care; she feels her needs are not being respected. As a result she understandably feels unsupported and stops trusting him.
        - she may feel powerless to get what she needs without giving unsolicited advice or criticism
        - understanding he is rejecting not her needs but the way she is approaching him, she can take his rejection less personally and explore more supportive ways of communicating her needs.
        - A man wants to make improvements when he feels he is being approached as the solution to a problem rather than as the problem itself.
        - One of the biggest differences between men and women is how they cope with stress. Men become increasingly focused and withdrawn while women become increasingly overwhelmed and emotionally involved.
        - He feels better by solving problems while she feels better by talking about problems.

        - When a Martian gets upset he never talks about what is bothering him. He would never burden another Martian with his problem unless his friend’s assistance was necessary to solve the problem. Instead he becomes very quiet and goes to his private cave to think about his problem, mulling it over to find a solution. When he has found a solution, he feels much better and comes out of his cave. If he can’t find a solution then he does something to forget his problems, like reading the news or playing a game. By disengaging his mind from the problems of his day, gradually he can relax. If his stress is really great it takes getting involved with something even more challenging, like racing his car, competing in a contest, or climbing a mountain.
        - When a Venusian becomes upset or is stressed by her day, to find relief, she seeks out someone she trusts and then talks in great detail about the problems of her day. When Venusians share feelings of being overwhelmed, they suddenly feel better.
        - When a man is stressed he will withdraw into the cave of his mind and focus on solving a problem. He generally picks the most urgent problem or the most difficult. He becomes so focused on solving this one problem that he temporarily loses awareness of everything else. Other problems and responsibilities fade into the background. At such times, he becomes increasingly distant, forgetful, unresponsive, and preoccupied in his relationships.
        - His mind is preoccupied, and he is powerless to release it. If, however, he can find a solution, instantly he will feel much better and come out of his cave; suddenly he is available for being in a relationship again. However, if he cannot find a solution to his problem, then he remains stuck in the cave. To get unstuck he is drawn to solving little problems, like reading the news, watching TV,
        - When a man is stuck in his cave, he is powerless to give his partner the quality attention she deserves. ... she feels he is ignoring her.
        - It is a mistake to expect a man to always be in touch with his loving feelings just as it is a mistake to expect a woman’s feelings to always be rational and logical.
- ### New #[[/highlights]] added [[April 11th, 2021]] at 10:09 PM
    - men generally have little awareness of how distant they become when they are in the cave. As a man recognizes how withdrawing into his cave may affect women, he can be compassionate when she feels neglected and unimportant.
    - When a man begins to ignore his wife, she often takes it personally. Knowing that he is coping with stress in his own way is extremely helpful but does not always help her alleviate the pain. At such times she may feel the need to talk about these feelings. This is when it is important for the man to validate her feelings. He needs to understand that she has a right to talk about her feelings of being ignored and unsupported just as he has a right to withdraw into his cave and not talk.
    - When a woman is stressed she instinctively feels a need to talk about her feelings and all the possible problems that are associated with her feelings. When she begins talking she does not prioritize the significance of any problem. If she is upset, then she is upset about it all, big and small. She is not immediately concerned with finding solutions to her problems but rather seeks relief by expressing herself and being understood. By randomly talking about her problems, she becomes less upset.
    - As a man under stress tends to focus on one problem and forget others, a woman under stress tends to expand and become overwhelmed by all problems. By talking about all possible problems without focusing on problem-solving she feels better. Through exploring her feelings in this process she gains a greater awareness of what is really bothering her, and then suddenly she is no longer so overwhelmed. To feel better, women talk about past problems, future problems, potential problems, even problems that have no solutions. The more talk and exploration, the better they feel. This is the way women operate. To expect otherwise is to deny a woman her sense of self.
    - To forget her own painful feelings a woman may become emotionally involved in the problems of others.
    - Martians talk about problems for only two reasons: they are blaming someone or they are seeking advice. If a woman is really upset a man assumes she is blaming him. If she seems less upset, then he assumes she is asking for advice. If he assumes she is asking for advice, then he puts on his Mr. Fix-It hat to solve her problems. If he assumes she is blaming him, then he draws his sword to protect himself from attack.
    - If he is wise and just listens, then a few moments after she is complaining about him, she will change the subject and talk about other problems as well.
    - Men also become impatient when women talk about problems in great detail. A man mistakenly assumes that when a woman talks in great detail that all the details are necessary for him to find a solution to her problem. He struggles to find their relevance and becomes impatient. Again he doesn’t realize that she is looking not for a solution from him but for his caring and understanding. ... Another reason a man may resist listening is that he is looking for the bottom line. He cannot begin formulating his solution until he knows the outcome.
    - Just as a man is fulfilled through working out the intricate details of solving a problem, a woman is fulfilled through talking about the details of her problems.
    - After the Martians learned how to listen they made a most amazing discovery. They began to realize that listening to a Venusian talk about problems could actually help them come out of their caves in the same way as watching the news on TV or reading a newspaper. Similarly, as men learn to listen without feeling blamed or responsible, listening becomes much easier.
    - The Venusians also found peace of mind when they finally understood that a Martian going into his cave was not a sign that he didn’t love her as much. They learned to be more accepting of him at these times because he was experiencing a lot of stress. The Venusians were not offended when Martians were easily distracted. When a Venusian talked and a Martian became distracted, she would very politely stop talking, stand there, and wait for him to notice. Then she would begin talking again. She understood that sometimes it was hard for him to give his full attention. The Venusians discovered that by asking for the Martians’ attention in a relaxed and accepting manner the Martians were happy to redirect their attention. When the Martians were completely preoccupied and in their caves, the Venusians also did not take it personally. They learned that this was not the time to have intimate conversations but a time to talk about problems with their friends or have fun and go shopping. When the Martians thereby felt loved and accepted, the Venusians discovered that the Martians would more quickly come out of their caves.
    - Men are motivated and empowered when they feel needed…. Women are motivated and empowered when they feel cherished.
    - when he feels trusted to do his best to fulfill her needs and appreciated for his efforts, he is empowered and has more to give.
    - when she feels cared for and respected, she is fulfilled and has more to give as well.
    - Martians have a win/lose philosophy—I want to win, and I don’t care if you lose. ... in tennis I not only want to win but also try to make my friend lose by making it difficult for him to return my shots. I enjoy winning even though my friend loses.
    - Given the opportunity to prove his potential, a man expresses his best self.
- ### New #[[/highlights]] added [[April 12th, 2021]] at 11:31 AM
    - To experience fulfillment he must begin to live his life motivated by love. Being inspired to give in such a free and selfless way liberates him from the inertia of self-gratification devoid of caring for others. Although he still needs to receive love, his greatest need is to give love.
    - When a man doesn’t feel he is making a positive difference in someone else’s life, it is hard for him to continue caring about his life and relationships. It is difficult to be motivated when he is not needed. To become motivated again he needs to feel appreciated, trusted, and accepted. Not to be needed is a slow death for a man.
    - Most men have little awareness of how important it is to a woman to feel supported by someone who cares. Women are happy when they believe their needs will be met. When a woman is upset, overwhelmed, confused, exhausted, or hopeless what she needs most is simple companionship. She needs to feel she is not alone. She needs to feel loved and cherished.
    - A woman’s tendency to be compulsive relaxes as she remembers that she is worthy of love—she doesn’t have to earn it; she can relax, give less, and receive more. She deserves it.
- ### New #[[/highlights]] added [[April 12th, 2021]] at 5:15 PM
    - As a man experiences limits, he is motivated to give more. Through respecting limits, he automatically is motivated to question the effectiveness of his behavior patterns and to start making changes.
    - Because she is afraid of not being supported, she unknowingly pushes away the support she needs. When a man receives the message that she doesn’t trust him to fulfill her needs, then he feels immediately rejected and is turned off.
    - “Needing” is openly reaching out and asking for support from a man in a trusting manner, one that assumes that he will do his best. This empowers him. “Neediness,” however, is desperately needing support because you don’t trust you will get it. It pushes men away and makes them feel rejected and unappreciated.
    - A man’s deepest fear is that he is not good enough or that he is incompetent. He compensates for this fear by focusing on increasing his power and competence. Success, achievement, and efficiency are foremost in his life. Before they discovered the Venusians, the Martians were so concerned with these qualities that they didn’t care about anything or anybody else. A man appears most uncaring when he is afraid.
    - Just as women are afraid of receiving, men are afraid of giving.
    - When a man is insecure he may compensate by not caring about anybody except himself. His most automatic defensive response is to say “I don’t care.”
    - The first step for a man in learning how to give more is to realize that it is OK to make mistakes and it is OK to fail and that he doesn’t have to have all the answers.
    - Just as women are sensitive to feeling rejected when they don’t get the attention they need, men are sensitive to feeling that they have failed when a woman talks about problems. This is why it is so hard for him to listen sometimes. He wants to be her hero. When she is disappointed or unhappy over anything, he feels like a failure.
        - **Note**: It is difficult for a man to listen to a woman when she is unhappy or disappointed because he feels like a failure.
    - EXPRESSING FEELINGS VERSUS EXPRESSING INFORMATION
        - **Note**: Women talk how it feels to them, not what factually it is. Men talk what it is as informative and concept, not how they feel about it. Women are so dramatic, generalised and indirect with their words never meant to take literally while men are to the point, direct and exact meaning of the word they use.
    - To fully express their feelings, women assume poetic license to use various superlatives, metaphors, and generalizations.
- ### New #[[/highlights]] added [[April 13th, 2021]] at 10:44 AM
    - Women think out loud, sharing their process of inner discovery with an interested listener. ... But men process information very differently. Before they talk or respond, they first silently “mull over” or think about what they have heard or experienced. Internally and silently they figure out the most correct or useful response. They first formulate it inside and then express it. This process could take from minutes to hours. And to make matters even more confusing for women, if he does not have enough information to process an answer, a man may not respond at all.
    - Women ... need to learn that when a man is upset or stressed he will automatically stop talking and go to his “cave” to work things out. They need to learn that no one is allowed in that cave, not even the man’s best friends. ... They need gradually to learn that if you just let men go into their caves, after a while they will come out and everything will be fine.
    - This lesson is difficult for women because on Venus one of the golden rules was never to abandon a friend when she was upset. It just doesn’t seem loving to abandon her favorite Martian when he is upset. Because she cares for him, a woman wants to come into his cave and offer him help. In addition, she often mistakenly assumes that if she could ask him lots of questions about how he is feeling and be a good listener, then he would feel better. This only upsets Martians more.
    - Why Men Go into Their Caves ... 1. He needs to think about a problem and find a practical solution to the problem. 2. He doesn’t have an answer to a question or a problem. Men were never taught to say “Gee, I don’t have an answer. I need to go into my cave and find one.” Other men assume he is doing just that when he becomes quiet. 3. He has become upset or stressed. At such times he needs to be alone to cool off and find his control again. He doesn’t want to do or say anything he might regret. 4. He needs to find himself. This fourth reason becomes very important when men are in love. At times they begin to lose and forget themselves. They can feel that too much intimacy robs them of their power. They need to regulate how close they get. Whenever they get too close so as to lose themselves, alarm bells go off and they are on their way into the cave. As a result they are rejuvenated and find their loving and powerful self again.
    - Why Women Talk ... To convey or gather information. (This is generally the only reason a man talks.) 2. To explore and discover what it is she wants to say.(He stops talking to figure out inside what he wants to say. She talks to think out loud.) 3. To feel better and more centered when she is upset.(He stops talking when he is upset. In his cave he has a chance to cool off.) 4. To create intimacy. Through sharing her inner feelings she is able to know her loving self. (A Martian stops talking to find himself again. Too much intimacy, he fears, will rob him of himself.)
    - Never go into a man’s cave or you will be burned by the dragon!
    - To make a man feel wrong for going into his cave has the effect of pushing him back into the cave even when he wants to come out.
        - **Note**: the more women try to get them to talk or come out of the cave, the longer it takes.
    - How to Support a Man in His Cave Don’t disapprove of his need for withdrawing. Don’t try to help him solve his problem by offering solutions. Don’t try to nurture him by asking questions about his feelings. Don’t sit next to the door of the cave and wait for him to come out. Don’t worry about him or feel sorry for him. Do something that makes you happy. If you need to “talk,” write him a letter to be read later when he is out, and if you need to be nurtured, talk to a friend. Don’t make him the sole source of your fulfillment.
    - A man wants his favorite Venusian to trust that he can handle what is bothering him. To be trusted that he can handle his problems is very important to his honor, pride, and self-esteem. ... He wants her to be happy so that he has one less problem to worry about. In addition he wants her to be happy because it helps him to feel loved by her. When a woman is happy and free from worry, it is easier for him to come out.
    - A man feels supported when a woman communicates in a way that says “I trust you to handle things unless you directly ask for help.”
    - she should definitely not offer criticism or advice unless he asks. Instead, she should try giving him loving acceptance. This is what he needs, not lectures. As he begins to feel her acceptance, he will begin to ask what she thinks. If, however, he detects her demanding that he change, he will not ask for advice or suggestions. Especially in an intimate relationship, men need to feel very secure before they open up and ask for support. In addition to patiently trusting her partner to grow and change, if a woman is not getting what she needs and wants, she can and should share her feelings and make requests (but again without giving advice or criticism). This is an art that requires caring and creativity.
- ### New #[[/highlights]] added [[April 13th, 2021]] at 1:12 PM
    - A man looks for advice or help only after he has done what he can do alone. If he receives too much assistance or receives it too soon, he will lose his sense of power and strength. He becomes either lazy or insecure.
    - It is very difficult for a man to differentiate between empathy and sympathy. He hates to be pitied.
    - Men need to find ways to show they care while women need to find ways to show they trust.
    - The important point here is that to enrich our relationships we need to make little changes. Big changes generally require some suppression of who we truly are. This is not good.
    - four magic words: “I will be back.” When a man pulls away, a woman appreciates him saying out loud “I need some time to think about this, I will be back” or “I need some time to be alone. I will be back.”
    - A woman should not be judged for needing this reassurance, just as a man should not be judged for needing to withdraw.
    - The four magic words to support a man are “It’s not your fault.” When a woman is expressing her upset feelings she can support a man by pausing occasionally to encourage him by saying “I really appreciate your listening, and if this sounds as if I’m saying it’s your fault, that’s not what I mean. It’s not your fault.”
    - Another approach that I find most helpful is to remember that she always has a right to be upset and that once she gets it out, she will feel much better. This awareness allows me to relax and remember that if I can listen without taking it personally, then when she needs to complain she will be so appreciative of me. Even if she was blaming me, she will not hold on to it.
        - ^^She has right to upset. Don’t expect her to be okay all time despite doing everything for her. When she blames, she doesn’t hold to it, so don’t take it personally but listen empathetically. ^^

    - Rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle. This cycle involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again.
        - **Note**:  [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
    - She pulls back when she doesn’t trust him to understand her feelings, when she has been hurt and is afraid of being hurt again, or when he has done something wrong and disappointed her.
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
    - A man pulls away to fulfill his need for independence or autonomy. When he has fully stretched away, then instantly he will come springing back. When he has fully separated, then suddenly he will feel his need for love and intimacy again. Automatically he will be more motivated to give his love and receive the love he needs. When a man springs back, he picks up the relationship at whatever degree of intimacy it was when he stretched away. He doesn’t feel any need for a period of getting reacquainted again. ... If a man does not have the opportunity to pull away, he never gets a chance to feel his strong desire to be close. ... when a man has stretched away his full distance, he will return with a lot of power and spring. Once he pulls away to his limit, he begins to go through a transformation. His whole attitude begins to shift. This man who did not seem to care about or be interested in his partner (while he was pulling away) suddenly cannot live without her. He is now feeling again his need for intimacy. His power is back because his desire to love and be loved have been reawakened. This is generally puzzling for a woman because in her experience if she has pulled away, becoming intimate again requires a period of reacquaintance. If she doesn’t understand that men are different in this way, she may have a tendency to mistrust his sudden desire for intimacy and push him away. Men also need to understand this difference. When a man springs back, before a woman can open up again to him she generally wants and needs time and conversation to reconnect. This transition can be more graceful if a man understands a woman may need more time to regain the same level of intimacy—especially if she felt hurt when he pulled away.
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
    - man automatically alternates between needing intimacy and autonomy.
        - **Note**: #-useforsummary  [[+ rubber band effect in man]] [[couple's intimacy cycle]]
    - To a certain extent a man loses himself through connecting with his partner. By feeling her needs, problems, wants, and emotions he may lose touch with his own sense of self. Pulling away allows him to reestablish his personal boundaries and fulfill his need to feel autonomous.
    - For many women, a man tends to pull away precisely at the time when she wants to talk and be intimate. This occurs for two reasons: 1.A woman will unconsciously sense when a man is pulling away and precisely at those times she will attempt to reestablish their intimate connection and say “Let’s talk.” As he continues to pull away, she mistakenly concludes that he doesn’t want to talk or that he doesn’t care for her. 2. When a woman opens up and shares deeper and more intimate feelings it may actually trigger a man’s need to pull away. A man can only handle so much intimacy before his alarm bells go off, saying it is time to find balance by pulling away. At the most intimate moments a man may suddenly automatically switch to feeling his need for autonomy and pull away.
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
            - #-useforsummary women’s need for talk and to be listened
    - It is not that he doesn’t want to hear her feelings. At another time in his intimacy cycle, when he is needing to get close, the same feelings that could have triggered his departure will draw him closer. It is not what she says that triggers his departure but when she says it.
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]] [[Ladies or Women or Female Psychology]] 
    - When a man is pulling away is not the time to talk or try to get closer. Let him pull away. After some time, he will return. He will appear loving and supportive and will act as though nothing has happened. This is the time to talk. At this golden time, when a man wants intimacy and is actually available to talk, women generally don’t initiate conversations. This occurs for these three common reasons: 1.A woman is afraid to talk because the last time she wanted to talk he pulled away. She mistakenly assumes that he doesn’t care and he doesn’t want to listen. 2. A woman is afraid the man is upset with her and she waits for him to initiate a conversation about his feelings. She knows that if she were suddenly to pull away from him, before she could reconnect she would need to talk about what happened. She waits for him to initiate a conversation about what upset him. He, however, doesn’t need to talk about his upset feelings because he is not upset. 3. A woman has so much to say that she doesn’t want to be rude and…
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
    - When a woman wants to talk or feels the need to get close, she should do the talking and not expect a man to initiate the conversation. To initiate a conversation she needs to be the first to begin sharing, even if her partner has little to say. As she appreciates him for listening, gradually he will have more to say. A man can be very open to having a conversation with a woman but at first have nothing to say. What women don’t know about Martians is that they need to have a reason to talk. They don’t talk just for…
    - A woman sharing her thoughts naturally motivates a man to talk. But when he feels a demand is being made that he talk, his mind goes blank. He has nothing to say. Even if he has something…
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
    - A man needs to feel accepted just the way he is, and then he will gradually open up. He does not feel accepted when she wants him to talk…
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
    - Without appreciation and encouragement, a man may lose interest because he feels as though his “listening” is “doing nothing.”
        - **Note**: Women need to talk, men need to listen empathetically and not taking personally #-useforsummary
    - When a man gets too close and doesn’t pull away, common symptoms are increased moodiness, irritability, passiveness, and defensiveness.
    - There are two ways a woman may unknowingly obstruct her male partner’s natural intimacy cycle. They are: (1) chasing him when he pulls away; and (2) punishing him for pulling away.
        - **Note**: [[+ rubber band effect in man]]
    - Understanding this male intimacy cycle is just as important for men as it is for women. Some men feel guilty needing to spend time in their caves or they may get confused when they start to pull away and then later spring back. They may mistakenly think something is wrong with them.

    - Men are like rubber bands. When they pull away, they can stretch only so far before they come springing back. Rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle. This cycle involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again.
    - Rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle. This cycle involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again. ... Men instinctively feel this urge to pull away. It is not a decision or choice. It just happens. It is neither his fault nor her fault. It is a natural cycle. ... A man pulls away to fulfill his need for independence or autonomy. ... When he has fully separated, then suddenly he will feel his need for love and intimacy again. Automatically he will be more motivated to give his love and receive the love he needs. When a man springs back, he picks up the relationship at whatever degree of intimacy it was when he stretched away. He doesn’t feel any need for a period of getting reacquainted again.
    - Women misinterpret a man’s pulling away because generally a woman pulls away for different reasons. She pulls back when she doesn’t trust him to understand her feelings, when she has been hurt and is afraid of being hurt again, or when he has done something wrong and disappointed her. Certainly a man may pull away for the same reasons, but he will also pull away even if she has done nothing wrong.
    - when a man has stretched away his full distance, he will return with a lot of power and spring. Once he pulls away to his limit, he begins to go through a transformation. His whole attitude begins to shift. This man who did not seem to care about or be interested in his partner (while he was pulling away) suddenly cannot live without her. He is now feeling again his need for intimacy. His power is back because his desire to love and be loved have been reawakened. This is generally puzzling for a woman because in her experience if she has pulled away, becoming intimate again requires a period of reacquaintance. If she doesn’t understand that men are different in this way, she may have a tendency to mistrust his sudden desire for intimacy and push him away.
    - A man automatically alternates between needing intimacy and autonomy.

    - A woman is like a wave. When she feels loved her self-esteem rises and falls in a wave motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down. This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom suddenly her mood will shift and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically her wave begins to rise back up. When a woman’s wave rises she feels she has an abundance of love to give, but when it falls she feels her inner emptiness and needs to be filled up with love. This time of bottoming out is a time for emotional housecleaning. If she has suppressed any negative feelings or denied herself in order to be more loving on the upswing of her wave, then on the downswing she begins to experience these negative feelings and unfulfilled needs. During this down time she especially needs to talk about problems and be heard and understood.
    - At her down times, she tends to be overwhelmed or more emotionally reactive. When her wave hits bottom she is more vulnerable and needs more love. It is crucial that her partner understand what she needs at these times, otherwise he may make unreasonable demands.
    - Men pull back and then get close, while women rise and fall in their ability to love themselves and others.
    - A man assumes that her sudden change of mood is based solely on his behavior. When she is happy he takes credit, but when she is unhappy he also feels responsible. He may feel extremely frustrated because he doesn’t know how to make things better. One minute she seems happy, and so he believes he is doing a good job and then the next minute she is unhappy. He is shocked because he thought he was doing so well.
    - The last thing a woman needs when she is on her way down is someone telling her why she shouldn’t be down. What she needs is someone to be with her as she goes down, to listen to her while she shares her feelings, and to empathize with what she is going through. Even if a man can’t fully understand why a woman feels overwhelmed, he can offer his love, attention, and support.
    - when a woman goes into her well, if she feels supported she doesn’t necessarily feel better right away. She may feel worse. But that is a sign that his support may be helping. His support may actually help her to hit bottom sooner, and then she can and will feel better. To genuinely come up she first needs to hit bottom. That is the cycle.
    - Even when a man is succeeding in supporting a woman she may become even more upset.
    - ### RECURRING CONVERSATIONS AND ARGUMENTS
        - When a woman goes into her well her deepest issues tend to surface. These issues may have to do with the relationship, but usually they are heavily charged from her past relationships and childhood. Whatever remains to be healed or resolved from her past inevitably will come up.
        - As she feels more and more supported at these difficult times, she begins to trust the relationship and is able to journey in and out of her well without conflict in her relationship or struggle in her life. This is the blessing of a loving relationship. To support a woman when she is in her well is a special gift that she will greatly appreciate. Gradually she will become free from the gripping influence of her past. She will still have her ups and downs, but they will not be so extreme that they overshadow her loving nature.
        - ### Reassuring Insights
            - 1. A man’s love and support cannot instantly resolve a woman’s issues. His love, however, can make it safe for her to go deeper into her well. It is naïve to expect a woman to be perfectly loving all the time. He can expect these issues to come up again and again. Each time, however, he can get better at supporting her. 2. A woman going into her well is not a man’s fault or his failure. By being more supportive he cannot prevent it from happening, but he can help her through these difficult times. 3. A woman has within herself the ability to spontaneously rise up after she has hit bottom. A man does not have to fix her. She is not broken but just needs his love, patience, and understanding.
            - When a woman doesn’t feel safe to go into her well, her only alternative is to avoid intimacy and sex or to suppress and numb her feelings through addictions like drinking, overeating, overworking, or overcaretaking. Even with her addictions, however, she periodically will fall into her well and her feelings may come up in a most uncontrolled fashion.
            - When negative feelings are suppressed positive feelings become suppressed as well, and love dies. Avoiding arguments and fights certainly is healthy but not by suppressing feelings.
            - ### Emotional Housecleaning
                - When a woman’s wave crashes is a time of emotional cleansing or emotional housecleaning. Without this cleansing or emotional catharsis a woman slowly loses her ability to love and to grow in love. Through controlled repression of her feelings her wave nature is obstructed, and she gradually becomes unfeeling and passionless over time.
                - One study revealed that a woman’s self-esteem generally rises and falls in a cycle between twenty-one and thirty-five days.
                - A wise man learns to go out of his way to help a woman feel safe to rise and fall. He releases his judgments and demands and learns how to give the required support. As a result he enjoys a relationship that increases in love and passion over the years. He may have to weather a few emotional storms or droughts, but the reward is much greater. The uninitiated man still suffers from storms and droughts, but because he does not know the art of loving her through her time in the well, their love stops growing and gradually becomes repressed.
                - Telling a woman she shouldn’t feel hurt is about the worst thing a man can say. It hurts her even more, like poking a stick into an open wound. When a woman is feeling hurt, she may sound as if she is blaming him. But if she is given care and understanding, the blame will disappear. Trying to explain to her why she shouldn’t be hurt will make matters much worse. Sometimes when a woman is hurting she may even agree intellectually that she shouldn’t be hurting. But emotionally she is still hurting and doesn’t want to hear from him that she shouldn’t be hurting. What she needs is his understanding of why she is hurting.
                - Men argue for the right to be free while women argue for the right to be upset. Men want space while women want understanding.
                - Three Steps for Supporting Her When He Needs to Pull Away 1. Accept Your Limitations The first thing you need to do is accept that you need to pull away and have nothing to give. No matter how loving you want to be, you cannot listen attentively. Don’t try to listen when you can’t. 2. Understand Her Pain Next, you need to understand that she needs more than you can give at this moment. Her pain is valid. Don’t make her wrong for needing more or for being hurt. It hurts to be abandoned when she needs your love. You are not wrong for needing space, and she is not wrong for wanting to be close. You may be afraid that she will not forgive you or trust. She can be more trusting and forgiving if you are caring and understanding of her hurt. 3. Avoid Arguing and Give Reassurance By understanding her hurt you won’t make her wrong for being upset and in pain. Although you can’t give the support she wants and needs, you can avoid making it worse by arguing. Reassure her that you will be back, and then you will be able to give her the support she deserves.
                - Remember, if a man needs to pull away like a rubber band, when he returns he will be back with a lot more love. Then he can listen. This is the best time to initiate conversation.
                - It puts too much pressure on a man to make him the only source of love and support.

    - As a woman’s financial needs are fulfilled she becomes more aware of her emotional needs.
    - A woman with money is expected to be fulfilled all the time because her life could be so much worse without this financial abundance. This expectation is not only impractical but disrespectful. Regardless of wealth, status, privilege, or circumstances, a woman needs permission to be upset and allow her wave to crash.
    - a woman is not supported in being unhappy sometimes then she can never truly be happy. To be genuinely happy requires dipping down into the well to release, heal, and purify the emotions. This is a natural and healthy process.
    - When a woman is on the upswing she can be fulfilled with what she has. But on the downswing she then will become aware of what she is missing. When she is feeling good she is capable of seeing and responding to the good things in her life. But when she is crashing, her loving vision becomes cloudy, and she reacts more to what is missing in her life. Just as a glass of water can be viewed as half full or half empty, when a woman is on her way up she sees the fullness of her life. On the way down she sees the emptiness. Whatever emptiness she overlooks on the way up comes more into focus when she is on her way down into her well.

    - A woman thrives when she feels adored and special. A man fulfills her need to be loved in this way when he makes her feelings and needs more important than his other interests—like work, study, and recreation. When a woman feels that she is number one in his life then, quite easily, she admires him. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006UN3K4O&location=2014))

    - The more intimate we are with someone, the more difficult it is objectively to hear their point of view without reacting to their negative feelings.
    - It is not what we say that hurts but how we say it.
    - Quite commonly when a man feels challenged, his attention becomes focused on being right and he forgets to be loving as well. Automatically his ability to communicate in a caring, respectful, and reassuring tone decreases.
    - A man unknowingly hurts his partner by speaking in an uncaring manner and then goes on to explain why she should not be upset. He mistakenly assumes she is resisting the content of his point of view, when really his unloving delivery is what upsets her.
    - when a woman feels challenged the tone of her speech automatically becomes increasingly mistrusting and rejecting. This kind of rejection is more hurtful to a man, especially when he is emotionally involved.
    - ### THE FOUR F’S FOR AVOIDING HURT
        - There are basically four stances that individuals take to avoid getting hurt in arguments. They are the four f’s: fight, flight, fake, and fold. Each of these stances offers a short-term gain, but in the long run they are all counterproductive.
- ### #[[/highlights]] added [[October 24th, 2021]] at 1:24 PM
    - ### 1. Fight.
        - Their motto is “the best defense is a strong offense.”
        - inner motive is to intimidate their partner into loving and supporting them.
        - ### 2. Flight.
            - passive-aggressive behavior
            - walk on eggshells in a relationship. Women commonly complain they have to walk on eggshells, but men do also.
            - indirectly hurt them by slowly depriving them of the love they deserve.
            - ### 3. Fake.
                - pretends that there is no problem.
                - Over time, however, these women become increasingly resentful; they are always giving to their partner but they do not get what they need in return. This resentment blocks the natural expression of love.
                - afraid to be honest about their feelings,
            - ### 4. Fold.
                - They will take the blame and assume responsibility for whatever is upsetting their partner. In the short run they create what looks like a very loving and supportive relationship, but they end up losing themselves.
                - To please their partners these people intuitively sense their partners’ desires and then mold themselves in order to please.
                - Any form of rejection is very painful because they are already rejecting themselves so much.
        - ## WHY WE ARGUE
            - discussions and negotiations, however, turn into painful arguments for only one reason—we are not feeling loved. Emotional pain comes from not feeling loved, and when a person is feeling emotional pain it is hard to be loving.
            - Men rarely say “I’m sorry” because on Mars it means you have done something wrong and you are apologizing. Women, however, say “I’m sorry” as a way to say “I care about what you are feeling.” It doesn’t mean they are apologizing for doing something wrong. The men reading this who rarely say “I am sorry” can create wonders by learning to use this aspect of the Venusian language. The easiest way to derail an argument is to say “I’m sorry.”

    - ### HEALING THE RESENTMENT FLU
        - The solution to this resentment is for her to take responsibility. She needs to take responsibility for having contributed to her problem by giving more and letting the score get so uneven. She needs to treat herself as if she has the flu or a cold and take a rest from giving so much in the relationship. She needs to pamper herself and allow her partner to take care of her more. When a woman feels resentful, she usually will not give her partner a chance to be supportive, or, if he tries, she will negate the value of what he has done and give him another zero. She closes the door to his support. By taking responsibility for giving too much, she can give up blaming him for the problem and start a new scorecard. She can give him another chance
        - When a man feels unappreciated, he stops giving support. A way he can responsibly deal with the situation is to understand that it is hard for her to give points for his support and appreciate him when she is sick with resentment.
        - realize how men and women keep score differently.
            - **Note**: In the beginning women are appreciative. Men are more giving. Later it changes to opposite due to their perception in scoring of point on giving.
        - 1. Martians Idealize Fairness.
        - for a woman, big things and little things score one point. All gifts of love are equal and equally needed—big and small.
        - Do not expect a woman to be satisfied unless she gets an abundance of little expressions of love as well as the big.
        - Remember that men are from Mars; they are not automatically motivated to do the little things. They give less not because they do not love you but because they believe they have already given their share. Try not to take it personally. Instead, repeatedly encourage their support by asking for more. Don’t wait until you desperately need his support or until the score is greatly uneven to ask. Don’t demand his support; trust that he wants to support you, even if he needs a little encouragement.
        - 2. Venusians Idealize Unconditional Love.
        - A woman gives as much as she can and only notices that she has received less when she is empty and spent.
        - When a woman continues to give freely with a smile on her face, a man assumes the score must be somewhat even. He does not realize that Venusians have the uncanny ability to give happily until the score is about thirty to zero.
        - 3. Martians Give When They Are Asked.
        - 4. Venusians Say Yes Even When the Score Is Uneven.
        - Remember that if she says yes to your requests, it doesn’t mean the score is even.
        - Remember that if you immediately say yes to a man’s requests, he gets the idea that he has given more or that the score is at least even. If you are giving more and getting less, stop saying yes to his requests. Instead, in a graceful way, begin asking him to do more for you.
        - 5. Martians Give Penalty Points.
            - **Note**: If men get hurt by women he can take away the points she earned, even it can go to negative. In that way he thinks she has to earn the lost points or if she is in negative points he thinks she has to earn (giving more) even to make it to zero.
- ### #[[/highlights]] added [[January 29th, 2022]] at 10:20 AM
    - Let her know how she has hurt you and then give her an opportunity to apologize. Punishment does not work! You will feel much better by giving her a chance to give you what you need. Remember she is a Venusian—she doesn’t know what you need or how she hurts you.
    - recognize he takes away points when he feels unloved and hurt and he immediately gives them back when he feels loved and supported.
    - To keep the score even in a relationship, a man really doesn’t require anything but love. Women don’t realize the power of their love and many times unnecessarily seek to earn a man’s love by doing more things for him than they want to do.
    - The secret to fulfilling a man lies in learning to express love through your feelings, not necessarily through your actions.
    - A man needs to prioritize “loving behavior,” for this will ensure that his partner’s love needs are met. ... A woman needs to prioritize “loving attitudes and feelings,” which will ensure that her partner’s love needs are fulfilled.
    - Sometimes women wonder why a man doesn’t say he is sorry for a big mistake. The answer is he is afraid of not being forgiven.
    - When a man is in a negative state, treat him like a passing tornado and lie low.
- ### #[[/highlights]] added [[February 10th, 2022]] at 10:00 AM
    - When men become upset, they tend to become judgmental of women and women’s feelings. Instead of remembering that his partner is vulnerable and sensitive, a man may forget her needs and sound mean and uncaring. When he feels a surge of negative feelings, it is especially difficult for him to speak in a caring, understanding, and respectful way. He doesn’t realize how hurtful his negative attitude is to her.
    - Instead of verbally sharing your feelings with your partner, write him or her a letter. Writing letters allows you to listen to your own feelings without worrying about hurting your partner. By freely expressing and listening to your own feelings, you automatically become more centered and loving.
    - Whether you share the feelings in your letter or you just write a letter to feel better, writing down your feelings is an essential tool.
    - Whether you write down your feelings or do it mentally, by exploring, feeling, and expressing your negative feelings they lose their power and positive feelings reemerge. The Love Letter Technique increases the power and effectiveness of this process tremendously. Although it is a writing technique, it can also be done mentally as well.
    - Do not stop your letter until you get to the love. Be patient and wait for the love to come out.
    - Feeling your anger may not help you at all. It may just make you more angry. The more you dwell on just your anger, the more upset you will become. Crying for hours may leave you feeling empty and spent, if you never move past the sadness. To feel only your fears may make you even more fearful. To feel sorry, without moving through it, may just make you feel guilty and ashamed and may even be harmful to your self-esteem. Trying to feel loving all the time will force you to suppress all your negative emotions, and after a few years, you will become numb and unfeeling.
        - **Note**: Why you should write to communicate or journal
    - People who get angry easily generally are trying to hide from their hurt, sadness, fear, or regret. When they feel their more vulnerable feelings, the anger goes away and they become more loving. People who cry easily generally have a hard time getting angry, but when they are helped to express anger they feel much better and more loving. People who are fearful generally need to feel and express their anger; the fear then goes away. People who often feel sorry and guilty generally need to feel and express their hurt and anger before they can feel the self-love they deserve. To feel sorry, without moving through it, may just make you feel guilty and ashamed and may even be harmful to your self-esteem. People who always feel loving but wonder why they are depressed or numb generally need to ask themselves this question: “If I were angry and upset about something, what would it be?” and write out the answers. This will help them get in touch with the feelings hidden behind the depression and numbness. Love Letters can be used in this fashion.
