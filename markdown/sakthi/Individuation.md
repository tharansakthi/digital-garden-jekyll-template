- [[Individuation]] is the process of forming 'one' SELF by merging the Conscious and undifferentiated Unconscious (Collective and Personal) 
- Individuation is in essence a natural process, which can't be forced. [[Flow State of Mind]]
    - There is no one size fits all. It takes different time and different state for different people
    - Individuation is an exceedingly difficult task: it always involves a conflict of duties, whose __solution requires us to understand that__ **our "counter-will" is also an aspect of God's will.** - [[Carl Jung]] #[[Complete Surrender]]  #[[* the crux]] #Tao #[[Geethasaaram]]
