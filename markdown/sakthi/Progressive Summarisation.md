            - “We hoard information because it gives us an illusion of knowledge.”
            - “You have to wrestle with information in order to turn it into knowledge. Once we’ve wrestled with it, then we’ve learned it.”
            - “We take notes, use them, and then throw them away. But what if we can perpetually use these notes over and over again for the rest of our lives? This means less knowledge jiu-jitsu and more distilled, ready-to-use wisdom.”
            - “When making notes for life, the trick is to leverage on the “present bias”. Write for the laziest, most forgetful version of your future self. Future you has no idea and no context about what your notes are about right now. They cannot access how it feels for you at this moment, where multiple mental nodes are active and things make sense, even though your notes are just a flurry of vague phrases.”
            - “In other words, write as if the person who will read them is reading it for the first time.”
            - “Progressive Summarization’s answer is to make notes skimmable by making key ideas pop.”
            - “If the first 4 layers are purification, then the 5th layer is alchemy.”
            - “Annotations are designed for notes to be easily skimmable and easily understood in the context of the text itself, not away from it.”
