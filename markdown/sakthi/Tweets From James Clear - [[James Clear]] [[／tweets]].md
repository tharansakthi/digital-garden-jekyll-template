    - To prioritize the day, think about the decade:
If I want to be on track to achieve that in 10 years, what do I need to do today?
        - What is an area you'd like to improve over the next decade? How are you working toward that outcome today? ^^Think long-term. Act short-term.^^

    - There is a difference between moving fast and rushing.

You can move fast and be thoughtful. When you rush, you sacrifice thoughtfulness.

Conversely, when you are thoughtful but not moving fast, you are overthinking it. Procrastination in disguise.

^^Don’t rush, but don’t wait.^^ [[+ think quick, plan flexible, decide promptly, do it fast, but don't rush]]
    - A simple question that often changes my behavior:

^^Does the amount of attention I’m giving this match its importance?^^

    - The more you create, the more powerful you become.

The more you consume, the more powerful others become.

    - 1) Do less. Stop dividing your attention.

2) Do it right now. Once you have identified the essential, go fast. Maintain a bias toward action.

3) Do it the right way. Acting quickly doesn't mean acting carelessly. Get to work right away, but keep working on it until it's right.
