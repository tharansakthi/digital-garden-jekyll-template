- Habit formation  #inbox
Unfortunately, many desirable behaviours don't have immediate rewards. 

Immediate rewards can help reinforce a new habit. A Harry Potter fan, for example, might listen to the audiobooks while exercising as an in-the-moment reward for working out.

Strict discipline and a rigid regime will not help better. But flexible rules will. For eg. do the exercise at any time of the day but has to do it for 30 mins (instead of doing every day at particular time)
