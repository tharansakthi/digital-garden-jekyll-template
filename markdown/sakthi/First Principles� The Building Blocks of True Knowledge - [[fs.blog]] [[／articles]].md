    - Reasoning by first principles removes the impurity of assumptions and conventions. What remains is the essentials. 
    - A first principle is a foundational proposition or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption. 
    - The difference between reasoning by first principles and reasoning by analogy is like the difference between being a chef and being a cook. If the cook lost the recipe, he’d be screwed. The chef, on the other hand, understands the flavor profiles and combinations at such a fundamental level that he doesn’t even use a recipe. He has real knowledge as opposed to know-how. 
    - reasoning by analogy might lead you astray.
    - First-principles reasoning cuts through dogma and removes the blinders. We can see the world as it is and see what is possible. 
    - When it comes down to it, everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoins. The list goes on. 
    - “To understand is to know what to do.”
— Wittgenstein #/quotes #Understanding #Learning
    - ### Socratic Questioning
        - Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) 
    - ### Let’s take a look at a few of the limiting beliefs that we tell ourselves.
        - “There is too much information out there.” 
        - “All the good ideas are taken.”
A common way that people limit what’s possible is to tell themselves that all the good ideas are taken. Yet, people have been saying this for hundreds of years — literally — and companies keep starting and competing with different ideas, variations, and strategies. 
        - two categories.
            - The first type of investor says there is too much information to consume. They spend their days reading every press release, article, and blogger commenting on a position they hold. They wonder what they are missing. 
            - The second type of investor realizes that reading everything is unsustainable and stressful and makes them prone to overvaluing information they’ve spent a great amount of time consuming. These investors, instead, seek to understand the variables that will affect their investments. While there might be hundreds, there are usually three to five variables that will really move the needle. The investors don’t have to read everything; they just pay attention to these variables. 
        - “We need to move first.” 
            - The iPhone wasn’t first, it was better. Microsoft wasn’t the first to sell operating systems; it just had a better business model. There is a lot of evidence showing that first movers in business are more likely to fail than latecomers 
            - Sometimes the early bird gets the worm and sometimes the first mouse gets killed. [[[[Early Bird]] vs [[First Mouse]]]]
        - “I can’t do that; it’s never been done before.” 
        - Analogies can’t replace understanding. #Understanding
