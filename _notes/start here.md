- **What?**
    - Sharing my knowledge with the world
- **How?**
    - I take notes while learning. I connect them for better understanding and to get new ideas from the past (old knowledge/notes) to perpetuate future notes. So to come up with a crux of knowledge and this database of notes become a reference/proof of my series of decision and to my future decisions. 
- **Why?** this site.
    - Writing is the best, easiest way to attain mental clarity.
        - [[write for better understanding and clarity]]
    - To learn quick and to learn the fact -> Teacher Learns the most
    - Learning Public / [[Why Write Public & Quick]]
        - no [[FOPO]] (and [[FOMO]])
    - To get opinions and help from peers (and make some friends)
        - and for some coffee too -> [paypal.me/alvistor](paypal.me/alvistor)
