- **What?**
    - Learning and Sharing my notes/knowledge with the world
- **How?**
    - While I share things formally at [alvistor.com](https://alvistor.com). Yet, I needed a quick and informal method to share my knowledge. 
        - So Sharing my interim Bi-directionally linked notes -> Check connected notes and connections in the graph view.
- **Why** this site?
    - Writing is the best, easiest way to attain mental clarity.
        - [[write for better understanding and clarity]]
    - To learn quick and to learn the fact -> Teacher Learns the most
    - Learning Public / [[Why Write Public & Quick]]
