- ### about these notes
    - I wanted to know understand and research on [[wholebeing]] or over all well-being. Thus, this knowledge garden is collection of stuff relevant to it. 
    - If the notes seem incomplete, short, and unconventional, then please understand, that these are just informal notes. It's more like a reference and repo in no particular format.
