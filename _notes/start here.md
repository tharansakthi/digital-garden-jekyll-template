- ### about these notes
    - If the notes seem incomplete, short, and unconventional, then please understand, that these are just informal notes. It's more like a reference and repo in no particular format.
    - You can see the more formal version of my writings at [alvistor.com](https://alvistor.com).
- ### How to get new updates on these notes?
    - Well, it's hard to pull the updated content as these notes are non-linear in nature.
