title: Flow State of Mind
---

- an optimal state of consciousness, a mental state where you feel your best and perform your best. More specifically, the term refers to those moments of rapt attention and total absorption, when you get so focused on the task at hand that everything else disappears. 
- Your sense of self/ego vanishes. Your sense of time distorts (either, typically, speeds up; or, occasionally, slows down). And throughout, all aspects of performance, both mental and physical, go through the roof.
- aka [Effortless Effort]() [* The Effortless Flow]()
- [Golden Rule of Flow]()
- **the experience of flow [As One]() where every decision, every action, flows seamlessly, perfectly, effortlessly, from the last**
    - ^^Decide and Act Simultaneously^^ - decision and action is one state.
        - it may not be possible initially to act before deciding, or choosing not to decide ((which itself a decision). but practice, suddenly one day you can achieve it. 
            - it will happen when you feel you can’t do it. when you are not desperate and in total inability. the point of “you don’t care” and stop trying [Wu Wei]()
        - like a shooter aims, pulls the trigger as same action in one moment.

    - 10 core characteristics of FLOW
        - **1. Action and Awareness Merge.** The doer and the doing become one. From the perspective of consciousness, we become the action. In other words, actions feel automatic and require little or no additional resources.
        - **2. Selflessness.** Our sense of self disappears. Our sense of self-consciousness as well. The inner critic is silenced.
        - **3. Timelessness.** We experience an altered perception of time. Past and future disappear and we are plunged into an eternal present, a deep now.
        - **4. Effortlessness.** Our sense of struggle and strife vanishes. The experience becomes intrinsically-rewarding or—in technical parlance—“[autotelic]().”
        - **5. Paradox of Control.** We have a powerful sense of control over the situation. We are the captain of our own ship; master of this small slice of destiny. (I would say we feel the action is in our control, mentally and physically)
        - **6. Intrinsic Motivation.** The experience is intrinsically motivating. We do it for love, not money. We do it because the activity itself is so incredibly enthralling that it’s its own reward. [autotelic]()
        - **7. Intense Concentration.** More specifically, intense concentration on a limited field of information. Total focus on the right here, right now. Complete absorption in the present moment.
        - **8. Challenge/Skills Balance.** The challenge of the task at hand slightly exceeds our skill set so we have to push ourselves outside our comfort zone. But not too far outside. ^^We have to stretch, not snap.^^
        - **9. Clear Goals.** These are not big goals (like winning the Olympics in downhill skiing), rather they are ^^much smaller chunks of goals^^ (like getting out of the starting gate fast). What’s critical is we know what we’re doing now and we know what we’re doing next so attention can stay focused in the present.
        - **10. Immediate Feedback.** The gap between cause and effect is tiny—so we can always course-correct mid-flight.
    - ### How to get into Flow State of Mind ((or) [Flow Triggers]()
        - **Complete concentration in present moment**
            - Zoning, [Cognitive Zoning]() which can be triggered [Flow Triggers]() by some external factors like music, environment (specific place) by [Pavlovian Conditioning]()
        - Making next action more obvious
            - knowing immediate next action 
        - Immediate Feedback
        - Clear Goals - Tiny goals like steps, one by one

        - Frown (forehead) muscles paralysed - sign of brain doing focused work
        - Guided by intuitions 
            - **5. Paradox of Control.** We have a powerful sense of control over the situation. We are the captain of our own ship; master of this small slice of destiny. (I would say we feel the action is in our control, mentally and physically)



- [Boon of Stillness]() makes as feel vulnerable as if we are losing the ground or wasting [Efficiency]() or the guilty of not doing anything when we are energetic. But, when it is executed in or with the right [Flow State of Mind](/flow-state-of-mind-4a3b98){: .internal-link}, it gives more strength and clarity.

- Individuation is in essence a natural process, which can't be forced. [Flow State of Mind](/flow-state-of-mind-4a3b98){: .internal-link}
    - There is no one size fits all. It takes different time and different state for different people
    - Individuation is an exceedingly difficult task: it always involves a conflict of duties, whose __solution requires us to understand that__ **our "counter-will" is also an aspect of God's will.** - [Carl Jung]() #[Complete Surrender]()  #[* the crux]() [Tao]() #[Geethasaaram]()
