- For Better Eye Sight, Which is better?
    - ^^Summary: even though the light mode performance is high, it is suitable for the short term, but there may be long-term costs.^^ #excerpt

        - Positive contrast polarity (light mode) refers to dark-font text on light background.
        - Negative contrast polarity (dark mode) denotes the combination of light (e.g., white) text on dark (e.g., black) background.
        - results showed that light mode won across all dimensions: irrespective of age, the positive contrast polarity was better for both **visual-acuity tasks and for proofreading tasks.** However, the difference between light mode and dark mode in the visual-acuity task was smaller for older adults than for younger adults — meaning that, **although light mode was better for older adults, too, they did not benefit from it as much as younger adults, at least in the visual-acuity task.**
        - during daytime, there was no significant effect of contrast polarity, but during nighttime, light mode led to better performance than dark mode
        - Long Term Effects
            - sustained exposure to light mode may be associated with myopia or nearsightedness
            - the dark mode also causes some issue in eye sight. - reduced acuity
