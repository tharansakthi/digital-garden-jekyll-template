- How to write a note or journal? You have to [[write for your future stupid self]] and why? #excerpt
- when you read your note it in future
    - remember that you don't remember everything, esp. the context of the note.
    - consider your future mind as a fresh mind that has not exposure to the work (that you made notes on)
    - Solution: consider your future "YOU" as a stupid person and write for him/her
- write clearly, 
    - no ambiguity
        - if you don't get the right word, then use multiple words to describe it
        - use no analogy (expect if you're explaining to others)
    - no misunderstanding 
        - anything can be misinterpreted if anyone intended to. 
            - try avoid as much as you can
                - No language exists that cannot be misused. Every interpretation is hypothetical, for it is a mere attempt to read an unfamiliar text - [[Karl Jung]] 
    - add contexts (when, where, who, reference sources)
    - add connections
    - re-read it again before closing the note
    - write your question and doubts along with the note
        - to answer later
        - to know you're not quite sure when writing it
    - write in block, so to rearrange it quickly
    - preserve atomicity of the note to connect it to others [[atomic note]]
