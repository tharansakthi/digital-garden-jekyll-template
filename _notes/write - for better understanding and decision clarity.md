        - writing shows the gap in your understanding (while when reading you assume things and your brain fills the gap with foggy logics ) [[illusion of knowledge]]

        - write in paper to remember it for longer [[memory retention]]

    - [[decision making]] benefits
        - describe the problem clearly (every detail, cause, reason, why it is problem and why you need to solve it)
            - “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” - [[Albert Einstein]]

            - no derailing of thoughts and stick to the goal - (focused thinking)
