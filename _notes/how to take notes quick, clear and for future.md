- understand before taking notes - do not copy paste and proceed with assumptions

        - [Building blocks of true knowledge: Atomic Understanding](https://alvistor.com/atomic-understanding/)
            - Deconstruct -> Understand -> Reconstruct
        - break it down to its atomicity - Atomic = forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.
            - until it reaches first principle
                - radius is a radius, you can’t deduce it further 
                - check [[first principle thinking]]
            - understand it by asking too many why's
                - [[atomic understanding]]
                - “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” - [[Albert Einstein]] [*](((FKIBsNlCz)))
                - we accept our primary understanding as it is by without asking questions.
                - be strong with your fundamental knowledge, in other words, make sure your [[atomic block]] in your [[atomic note]] is reliable and true
                    - each block is your note for future use and reference
                        - use tags, contexts which ever applicable to make easy for you to remember after a decade (date, time, people, place and things involved )
    - reconstruct it (comprehend it) with your own words
        - this is your summary notes as [[atomic note]] (not to be confused with evergreen notes)
            - that has a different [[atomic block]]s notes
                - a single atomic block may contribute to many atomic notes
                - an single atomic note may contribute to create many idea notes
        - write the note simple and in clear words. 
            - any notation, format or system is accepted as long as you understand when you read later
            - [[write for your future stupid self]]
            - write in "write once use many times" style
- eg. Gravity
    - Newton. Apple falls, why did it fall?, some thing attracted it, what is it, it is force. Where that force is from, may be earth. so earth attracts other objects towards itself. This force is gravity.
    - so for gravity, you need an atomic or unit understanding of pull or attraction between objects (mass attracts each other), that is force, finally objects. Reconstructing would be like object attracts each other,  force act on objects, the earth is also an object, an apple is also an object, they attract each other, as the earth is bigger in mass, thus apple moves towards earth, instead of the other way.
    - So my note structure will be - **this is eg of atomic blocks**
        - **Earth's Gravity** __(this my atomic block's note title - Gravity Block)__
            - **mass or objects attract each other** - (__Mass-and-Attraction Block__)
                - **this attraction acts as a pulling "Force"**  __(this final indent is my 'atomic block' - Force Block__)
        - (my comprehension will be - this is eg of atomic note)
            - **earth as an object attract any other object near it with a force because mass attract each other. This force is called gravity.**
