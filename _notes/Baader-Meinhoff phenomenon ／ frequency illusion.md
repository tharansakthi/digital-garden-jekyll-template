- aka frequency bias, frequency illusion
    - is a cognitive bias in which 
        - after you come to know about something new for the first time, there is a feeling or tendency that you notice it more often.
        - this leads to believe that this happens many times (frequency) than actually it is occurring. This is because you notice it often. Before you didn't recognize it, so didn't notice it. 
    - There's difference between knowing and aware.
