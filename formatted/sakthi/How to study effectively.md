            - Using our memory effectively is less about maximising exposure to a new source than figuring out how to use our prior knowledge, experience and expectation filters to integrate that source with what we already know.
                - making connections between what we know and what we reading now
                    - [Understanding]()
            - Our memory doesn’t passively reproduce a source: it actively reconstructs it according to our previous knowledge, experience and expectations.
                - [First Principles Thinking]() [Reflective Thought Understanding]()
            - [Spaced Repetition System]()
                - research in psychology has demonstrated that distributing your study time over a number of shorter sessions works better than cramming all the work into one marathon session. This is known as ‘the spacing effect’. 
                - In terms of the length of intervals between your sessions, research indicates that longer intervals tend to be associated (up to a point) with better retention. 
            - Contrary to how it might feel, both success and failure to retrieve information are helpful for your memory. Both outcomes serve to calibrate confidence in your perception of your knowledge. 
            - ^^When studying, it’s not what you think you know that matters, but rather what you can prove you know. ^^
                - Avoid assumptions and analogies [First Principles Thinking]() [Learning]()
            - The methods advocated above create ‘desirable difficulties’; they trade a bit of short-term pain for long-term gain.
                - **Remembering, Retaining Information** [trick/memorizing]()
            - **Systematic** ^^engagement with the meaning of your source material^^ is the key to successful studying.
            - Testing is not just a way of measuring learning; it can also be a powerful mechanism of learning. [Learning/Evaluation]() [Testing based learning]()
