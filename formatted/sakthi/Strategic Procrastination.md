- ref eg: Sometimes, when I'm trying to write—but every word I put on paper feels like a monumental effort—I'll walk away from my desk and do something else for a while. Inevitably, as soon as I'm not trying to write, I'll think of dozens of things I should be writing about. More output, less effort.
    - [Procrastination]() is not considered as [Bane of Stagnancy](). But it might lead to it in some cases.
        - Tip: Have a time-boxed procrastination
