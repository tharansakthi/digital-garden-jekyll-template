- Important things in Note taking. 
    1. First Purpose of it. What you want to get out of it. Be clear in this. 
        - Collect the notes based on Projects (Outcome oriented) than Categories (type of content, domain, etc)
    2. Only TWO phase in note taking & utilising it
        - ^^Divergence and Convergence^^
            - **Divergence** is expanding of Knowledge
                - by exploring and finding new domains and areas
            - **Convergence** is aggregating the knowledge into abstract or new idea
                - by mix and match the ideas collected and forming a new knowledge product
    3. Smaller Chunk of **Intermediate Packets**
        - take tiny notes (complete sentence and paragraph) ready to reused at any part of the 'Outcome notes' later. 
        - the smaller chunks is better to replace and reuse in different projects
        - Intermediate packets should be meaningful enough and the concept should complete within the chunk
    4. Take notes with **metadata** (Reference source, author, date)
    5. Write for your **Future Dumb Self**

    - The faintest [Writing]() is better than best memory
- [Comprehending]()
- 4 notes 
    - [outline notes]()
    - [evergreen notes]()
    - [permanent notes](), reference notes, literature notes
    - [transient notes]() - notes that don't have a complete meaning or goal. but a scratch that is evolving to one meaningful note. For me, it is 'inbox' (writing inbox) notes in Roam Research
