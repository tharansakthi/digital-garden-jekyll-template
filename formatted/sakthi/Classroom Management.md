- Keeping the students attentive or bring back to the attention - How?
    1. Use training/games from [Team Management training]()
    2. Code Words
        - Have **"attention code words"** and ask the students to do certain things when you say it in the middle of teaching
            - eg: Whenever you say "watzup" the students should harmoniously say "ohohooo" or (you say "hiphip" students say "hurray")
                - some codewords - "avengers assemble"
        - Have **"movement code word"** (usually a funny one like "vadai, samosa") - change the word (once a week)
            - the student won't move until you say the word and listen only to you until you finish instruction
                - avoids distraction, keep the class in attention and control and make them active 
        - Mood setting "trigger activity"
            - eg: ask the students to clap in a frequency - show the frequency by lowering or up your hand in the air 
            - eg: sit, stand, touch the nose, touch the ear
    3. Energizing Activity (freshening sleepy class)
        - Shoe Clap - ask students to tap their shoes on floor in the frequency of you clapping with hands
        - Frequency Clap conductor - ask the students to clap in frequency and intensity as you move your hands in the air up and down. The height determines the freq. and intensity of the students clap
        - Have **"attention code words"** and ask the students to do certain things when you say it in the middle of teaching
