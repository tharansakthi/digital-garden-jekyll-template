        - [my-words]() I tried hard to become honest, but the moment I stopped trying, I became honest.
    - Instead of using force to change the nature, using intelligence to **sail along it**
    - Trying ? What not to try

            - man made ideas of good and evil [Indifference]()
                - When people see some things as beautiful,
other things become ugly.
When people see some things as good,
other things become bad.

Being and non-being create each other.
Difficult and easy support each other.
Long and short define each other.
High and low depend on each other.
Before and after follow each other.

Therefore the Master
acts without doing anything ( [Wu Wei]() )
and teaches without saying anything.
Things arise and she lets them come;
things disappear and she lets them go.
She has but doesn't possess,
acts but doesn't expect.
When her work is done, she forgets it.
That is why it lasts forever. [Lao Tzu]()

    - The secret is
    - Not try , doing
    - Doing what comes
    - Perfecting the action by completely with it, become one with the action
    - Not for perfecting the result.
    - Doing forge sake of doing. Adapting with flow.
    - There is no focus on preparing or planning to perfect it. When you do with full attention and flexibility the action will mould you to the perfection of doing it. All you have to do is do to fulfil the purpose of doing that particular action, for best outcome yet not focusing on the results itself.
    - When you try to perfect the result you the worries will soon occupy your intentions of doing and this add the stress when you compare what you want and what the results you predicted. Slowly the urge to control the uncontrollable appears. The unhappiness of expectations failing makes you put more effort to correct the course while you go away from acting (doing) to managing the actions. This cause you obsessed of tweaking the actions which makes the conscious to become stressed and this gives the feeling of doing. Thus the doer and what has been in doing. It separates the action and mind. There is no flow. The actions are filled with efforts of rowing not in the flow of sailing.
    - The best comes out of you when you “do”. The moment you think about the results and it’s benefits the brain applies filters and checks everytime whether this will improve the results or not. Thus your conscious is occupied with lot of tiny decisions and hindering the flow. It blocks your mind from adapting and making you rigid and blind enough to see the natural and simple way. Most of the time the results we desire is based on what others desire. You want the results which people thinks it as success for which you will be praised. You just started to focusing on subjective opinions of others. Even if it is your own choice, you are not letting way to new possibilities when you fix a desired results.
    - The calculation of return of investment.
    - You have invested in you it will never go waste. If you see in such a way you invested in the action thus the return is the results which is mostly not in your control. You only can control yourself not how the events turn up. When you better at your work, you are being better as person. You carry the success with you , not your success gives you the name and fame, that is temporary even if you are lucky once or twice. The result of any action is what you gained out of it as a person. When you gain yourself, the even better self when you’re in the flow, the peaceful self with balance, that’s what the return of flow. The superior skills and what other people says success are just the by products of your effortless flow.
    - The worries of results.
    - When you focus on what you are, you attract what you want.
    - When you focus on what you want, you indirectly saying you don’t have it. So you attract lacking. Thus to fulfil lacking you always have to put effort.
    - Remember success is in the end, momentary. The path is success carries major timeline. You have to find a way that you are happy in the path that is throughout doing it. Not only on at the end. Success is not only depending on your skills and effort, there are many parameters and unintended benefits.
    - —
    - True intelligence is using knowledge when you see the events as objective factual truth instead of subjective truth of perception and belief or for the benefit of ego.
    - When you want to see the truth you will hold no opinions for or against it.
    - this true intelligence leads to wisdom when you act on as a truth with humility and love.
