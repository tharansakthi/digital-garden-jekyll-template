- “__the female, not the male, determines all the conditions of the animal family. Where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male, no such association takes place__.”
    - by Robert Briffault (1876 - 1948) was an English surgeon and anthropologist
    - ### Corollary 
        - **A woman may very well have received past benefits from her relationship with a man, but this does not guarantee her continuing the relationship with him.**
        - **Even when a woman promises to continue the relationship with a man in the future in exchange for some benefit derived from him today, her promise is worth nothing the moment she has received the benefit.**
            - DO NOT trust a woman's promise
        - **The man’s promise to a woman of any future benefit has limited value of securing an ongoing relationship with any woman, as his promise is useful only to the extent that the woman’s wait for the benefit is short and the extent that she trusts him to keep his promise.**
