This serves two purposes.

First, it fuels you up. Study after study have shown that breakfast is, yes, the most important meal of the day.

This works whether you do it with kids and/or a partner, or you’re solo.

And distract you from the things that really matter.

And make you angry, and bitter, and sullen, and hostile.
