This is not a mistake. God is gold. Prayer is productivity.

The decline in religious life is accompanied by a simultaneous rise in hyper-growth models and winner-take-all capitalism. We’ve conferred the role of moral steward and meaning-maker to a set of rules and habits designed to optimize our every waking moment, our sleep, our dreams. And the messengers of this new religion?

    - Purpose-first productivity doesn’t force us to wait until retirement to find fulfillment. Instead, it guides us toward the here, the now, this one moment in which we can have an active relationship with presence.
