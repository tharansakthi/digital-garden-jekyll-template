- **Correlations**
    - (a) human beings are motivated by a hierarchy of needs.
    - (b) needs are organized in a hierarchy of prepotency in which more basic needs must be more or less met (rather than all or none) prior to higher needs.
    - (c) the order of needs is not rigid but instead may be flexible based on external circumstances or individual differences.
    - (d) most behaviour is multi-motivated, that is, simultaneously determined by more than one basic need.
