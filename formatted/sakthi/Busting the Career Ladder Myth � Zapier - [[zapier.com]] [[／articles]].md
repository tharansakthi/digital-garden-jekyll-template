            - There's no ladder, there's only river. Each can set their own path and own destination in career.

    - I am not a robot. Some days I have more energy than others, or I'm better able to think of the big picture. And my work history also has periods of great change and some slower spells. Could it be that I don't need to move through my career at a steady pace, rung by inevitable rung?

Instead, I've come to accept that everything happens in its own time. Rather than feeling stuck on a career ladder when I haven't shifted roles for a while, I can rest secure in the knowledge that a river always flows, no matter how slowly. As long as I'm learning, I'm moving toward my ultimate goal, or ocean. For me, ^^it's not about climbing to the top. We can each define our own destinations.^^ Once we do, it becomes clearer which choices will help us reach that ocean.
    - ^^If you embrace your career as a river instead of a ladder, you're better able to confront these obstacles^^. When you reach a ceiling on the career ladder, the only way you can keep going is to shatter it. When your career river encounters an obstacle, you can go around it, or over it, or carve through it. You may be able to get past what's blocking your way quickly, or it may take some time, but in either case, you have several ways to get where you're trying to go.
    - Cooperation, not competition
    - A career ladder creates no value except for the person climbing it, while a career river feeds an entire ecosystem. I'd rather live in a professional world of rivers, where we all can go with the flow together.
