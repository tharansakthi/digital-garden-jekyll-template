- Phase 1 - How to survey the paper
    - To find the paper really worth the time to invest in it
    - Feel free to stop at any point when you get disinterested of the article
        - Read the title and keywords
        - Read abstract
        - Read the conclusion
- Phase 2 - Reading the paper
    - Look at the tables and figures
        - this is what was done in the work, this will not take much time, so it is worth looking at before really getting into the details (which will slow down the reading)
    - Read Introduction
    - Real Results and Discussion
        - this is heart of the paper.
        - if this is really relevant .. dig deep
    - Take notes on the paper
        - Take notes like you donâ€™t have to read the paper again
        - There should be a system for to collect all notes
            - Use Roam Research (or index card)
            - The faintest writing is better than best memory
