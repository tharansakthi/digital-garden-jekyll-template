- [Shadow]() [Psychology]()
    - those aspects of the **personality that we choose to reject and repress**. For one reason or another, we all have parts of ourselves that we don’t like—or that we think society won’t like—so we push those parts down into our unconscious psyches. It is this __collection of repressed aspects of our identity referred to as our__ **shadow**
        - First coined by Swiss Psychiatrist [Carl Jung]()

- Projection 
    - Seeing our darkness in others. [Shadow Projection]()
        - Although our conscious minds are avoiding our own flaws, they still want to deal with them on a deeper level, so we magnify those flaws in others. **First we reject, then we project. **
        - **If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.** - Hermann Hesse #/quotes 
        - Rather than confront the possibility of being wrong, therefore, people often go to extreme lengths to prove to themselves and others that they are right—even if it means hurting someone else.
- # Shadow Behaviour
    - Have you ever said or done something really shitty, mostly on an impulse, that you later regretted?
        - Those actions or words just came out of you without a second thought, just popping out like it is compressed in pressure. You never thought you would do that. This is a trigger of your "Shadow"
        - Rather than confront something that we don’t like, our mind pretends it does not exist. **Aggressive impulses, taboo mental images, shameful experiences, immoral urges, fears, irrational wishes, unacceptable sexual desires**—these are a few examples of shadow aspects, things people contain but do not admit to themselves that they contain. 
    - ### Examples of Shadow Behaviour
        - **A tendency to harshly judge others, especially if that judgment comes on an impulse. **
            - You may have caught yourself doing this once or twice when you pointed out to a friend how “ridiculous” someone else’s outfit looked. Deep down, you would hate to be singled out this way, so doing it to another reassures you that you’re smart enough not to take the same risks as the other person.
        - **Pointing out one’s own insecurities as flaws in another. **
            - The internet is notorious for hosting this. Scan any comments section and you’ll find an abundance of trolls calling the author and other commenters “stupid,” “moron,” “idiot,” “untalented,” “brainwashed,” and so on. Ironically, internet trolls are some of the most insecure people of all.
        - **A quick temper with people in subordinate positions of power. **
            - I caught this one all the time when I worked as a cashier, and it is the bane of all customer service employees. People are quick to cop an attitude with people who don’t have the power to fight back. **Exercising power over another is the shadow’s way of compensating for one’s own feelings of helplessness in the face of greater force.**
        - **Frequently playing the “victim” of every situation. **
            - Rather than admit wrongdoing, people go to amazing lengths to paint themselves as the poor, innocent bystander who never has to take responsibility.
        - **A willingness to step on others to achieve one’s own ends. **
            - **People often celebrate their own greatness without acknowledging times that they may have cheated others to get to their success**. You can see this happen on the micro level as people vie for position in checkout lines and cut each other off in traffic. On the macro level, corporations rig policy in their favour to gain tax cuts at the expense of the lower classes.
        - **Unacknowledged biases**
            - People form assumptions about others based on their appearance all the time—in fact, it’s a pretty natural (and often useful—e.g. noticing signs of a dangerous person) thing to do. However, we can easily take this too far, veering into toxic prejudice. But with so much social pressure to eradicate prejudice, people often find it easier to “pretend” that they’re not racist/homophobic/xenophobic/sexist, etc., than to do the deep work it would take to override or offset particularly destructive stereotypes they may be harbouring.
        - A [messiah complex]()
            - Some people think they’re so “enlightened” that they can do no wrong. They construe everything they do as an effort to “save” others—to help them “see the light,” so to speak. 
            - An example of [Inferior Virtue]() too. Showing your virtue to show off that you're a great person. 
            - This is actually an example of spiritual bypassing, yet another manifestation of the shadow. 
- # Origin of The Light and Shadow
    - “you” is only the part of your identity that is visible to you. Your conscious awareness is like a light enabling you to observe what is happening inside your mind.
    - Beneath that conscious “light” is a whole world of “darkness” containing those very aspects of ourselves that we have strived to ignore. The ego is only the tip of the iceberg floating above the sea, but the unconscious mind is the vast mountain of ice lurking beneath the surface.
        - **Much of that bulk consists of our repressed thoughts, memories, emotions, impulses, traits, and actions. Jung envisioned those rejected pieces coming together to form a large, unseen piece of our personality beneath our awareness, secretly controlling much of what we say, believe, and do.**
    - [FOLO]()[FOPO]() Fear of not being acceptable or fit in. The consequence is bad as we worry about others opinion. 
    - The only way to escape from this perpetual recurring pain is to **mask it**. all to mask perceived flaws and project an **image of “perfection"**.
- # How to handle shadow
    - ^^**Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.**^^ - [Carl Jung]() #/quotes [Law of Attraction]()
    - making the [Unconscious]() conscious is called "[Shadow Work]()" or [Individuation]()The steps are
        - Awareness - Seek to find the inner hidden "Shadow"
            - Meditation hugely helps
            - Accept - you have a shadow 
                - Do not repress what you have inside your mind, don't let it to form another form of psyche that hides and grows
            - Cultivating an awareness of the shadow is the first step to identifying our triggers—but before we can do that, we must first overcome our instinctive fear of our shadows.
        - Question - Why am I reacting this way?
            - Find - **psychological triggers, or events that prompt an instant and uncontrolled reaction from us** Again awareness meditation (watching our thoughts) helps
        - Embrace it, but not encourage it
            - Take the hidden side and make it blend with your original self. (In day to day)
                - Hating the 'shadow' part is like hating part of yourself.
                    - Once we identify the original sources of our psychological triggers (e.g. repressed fear, pain, aggression, etc.), only then can we begin to heal and integrate those wounded parts of ourselves. Integration, in Jung’s definition, means that we **cease rejecting parts of our personalities and find ways to bring them forward into our everyday lives**. We [accept our shadows](https://highexistence.com/carl-jung-on-why-we-must-never-pass-judgment-when-we-desire-to-help/) and seek to unlock the wisdom they contain.
            - **Only by embracing it true wholeness is achieved**
            - [Journaling]() helps to find your "Shadow" if you are honest in your writing
        - Now check whether you want it or not?
            - Don't worry much about what others think. Sometimes some shadows are good that not necessarily needed to be changed
        - Now address it if you want to remove it
            - Meditation and [subconscious prayer]() helps
            - Letting Go also helps, exactly doing nothing about it. not giving importance to it and focusing on other things (but only after getting it out from shadow)
    - Beware of [Spiritual Bypassing]()
        - It is suppressing our shadows by practicing spirituality or beliefs.
        - Before we can heal our pain, we should be honest about it and accept it
            - [Confessions]() (in Christianity) are good for this and being able to feel forgiven will make you accept it and ease you to deal with it.
